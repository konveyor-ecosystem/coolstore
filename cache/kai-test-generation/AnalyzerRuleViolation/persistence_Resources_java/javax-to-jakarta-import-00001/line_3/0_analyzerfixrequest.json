This is because the Java EE APIs have been rebranded to Jakarta EE, and the package names have changed accordingly.\n\nHere are the steps to update the code:\n\n1. Replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`.\n2. Update the `@Dependent` and `@Produces` annotations to use the new `jakarta.enterprise` package.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.persistence;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;\nimport javax.persistence.EntityManager;\nimport javax.persistence.PersistenceContext;\n\n@Dependent\npublic class Resources {\n\n    @PersistenceContext\n    private EntityManager em;\n\n    @Produces\n    public EntityManager getEntityManager() {\n        return em;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nTo complete this migration, the following changes should be made to the `pom.xml` file:\n\n* Update the `javaee-api` dependency to use the Jakarta EE API instead. This can be done by replacing the `javaee-api` artifact with `jakarta.platform:jakarta.jakartaee-api`.\n* Update the `maven-compiler-plugin` to use the correct Java version for Jakarta EE 9+.\n\nExample:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-api</artifactId>\n    <version>9.1.0</version>\n    <scope>provided</scope>\n</dependency>\n\n<plugin>\n    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n    <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>\n    <version>3.8.1</version>\n    <configuration>\n        <source>11</source>\n        <target>11</target>\n    </configuration>\n</plugin>\n```\nNote: The exact version numbers may vary depending on the specific requirements of your project.",
