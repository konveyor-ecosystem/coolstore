## Reasoning

To migrate the `beans.xml` file to Quarkus, we need to address the issues mentioned. 

First, we need to replace `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` and change the schema version number. This is required because Quarkus uses Jakarta EE instead of Java EE.

Next, we need to update the `beans_1_1.xsd` to `beans_3_0.xsd` and update the version attribute to `"3.0"`. This is because Quarkus uses a newer version of the CDI specification.

Finally, we can remove the `beans.xml` file altogether, as Quarkus ignores its content and it's not necessary for CDI to work.

## Updated File

```xml
<!-- This file can be removed, as Quarkus ignores its content and it's not necessary for CDI to work. -->
```

## Additional Information (optional)

No additional steps or dependencies need to be updated in the `pom.xml` file for this change. However, it's recommended to check the Quarkus guide for supported CDI features to ensure that the application is using the correct configuration.
