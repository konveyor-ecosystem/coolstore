["1. **Issue 1:** The package `javax.ejb` is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package for Jakarta EE, which is `jakarta.ejb`. This change is necessary because Quarkus is based on Jakarta EE, and the package names have been updated to reflect this.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, the package `javax.inject` is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package for Jakarta EE, which is `jakarta.inject`.\n\n3. **Issue 3, 4, 5, 6:** These import statements need to be updated from `javax.persistence` to `jakarta.persistence` for the same reason as Issues 1 and 2.\n\n4. **Issue 7:** In Quarkus, the `EntityManager` is automatically created and managed by the framework. Therefore, the `@Produces` annotation is not needed and should be removed. Additionally, the `@Stateless` annotation should be replaced with a scope annotation, such as `@ApplicationScoped`.\n\n5. **Issue 8:** The `EntityManager` should be injected using the `@Inject` annotation."]
