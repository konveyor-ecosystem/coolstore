## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 & 2:** The Java EE API packages have been renamed to `jakarta.*` in Quarkus. This is to ensure compatibility with Jakarta EE and to distinguish it from Java SE. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statements with `jakarta.enterprise` on lines 3 and 4.

2. **Issue 3:** In Quarkus, the `@Produces` annotation is not necessary if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. The `@Produces` annotation is used to indicate that a method produces a resource that should be managed by the container. However, Quarkus uses a different approach for dependency injection. Instead of using `@Produces`, we can use the `@Singleton` annotation to indicate that the bean should be a singleton and the `@Inject` annotation to inject it into other classes. Additionally, the field `log` can be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import jakarta.enterprise.inject.Instance;
import jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Producers {

    Logger log;

    @Inject
    public void setLog(Instance<Logger> logger) {
        this.log = logger.get();
    }

    @Singleton
    public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

* The `@Inject` annotation is used to inject the `Instance<Logger>` object into the `setLog` method.
* The `Instance<T>` interface provides a way to obtain an instance of a type at runtime.
* The `@Singleton` annotation is used to indicate that the `produceLog` method should be a singleton.
* The `@Named` annotation can be used to give a name to the `produceLog` method, which can then be used to inject it into other classes.

Note: The above solution assumes that the `Producers` class is not used as a CDI bean in other parts of the application. If it is, then the solution may need to be modified to ensure compatibility with CDI.
