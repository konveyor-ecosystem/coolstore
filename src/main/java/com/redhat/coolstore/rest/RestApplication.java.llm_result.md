## Reasoning

Issue 1 and 2: The import statements for `javax.ws.rs` need to be updated to `jakarta.ws.rs` to comply with the Quarkus framework. This is due to the fact that Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API instead of the Java EE API.

Issue 3 and 4: The `@ApplicationPath` and `public class RestApplication extends Application` annotations and implementation are not necessary in Quarkus. Quarkus automatically scans for REST endpoints, so there is no need to set a root path or extend the `Application` class.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;

// JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary
// @ApplicationPath("/services")
// public class RestApplication extends Application {
// }
```

## Additional Information

* Note that the updated file does not contain any annotations or implementation for the REST application.
* Make sure to update any other dependencies in the `pom.xml` file that may be affected by the migration to Quarkus.
* Be aware that there may be other issues that need to be addressed in subsequent steps.
