["1. The issue found in the static code analysis is that the import statement `javax.ws` needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ws` in order to migrate from Java EE to Quarkus.\n2. The `javax.ws.rs` package has been moved to the `jakarta.ws.rs` package in Quarkus, so we need to update the import statement accordingly.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the import statements are using `javax.ws` instead of the required `jakarta.ws` for Quarkus migration.\n2. Quarkus follows the Jakarta EE specifications, so the import statements need to be updated to reflect this change.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis states that JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary in Quarkus and setting a root path like this is not required.\n2. Quarkus uses a different approach for setting the root path for REST resources.\n3. We need to update the RestApplication class to reflect the changes needed for Quarkus.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is related to the JAX-RS activation which is no longer necessary in Quarkus. This means that the `@Path` annotation on the `RestApplication` class is not required in Quarkus.\n2. Quarkus provides a more streamlined approach to defining REST endpoints, where you can directly map resources to specific paths without the need for explicit activation annotations."]
