This is because we are migrating to Jakarta EE, which has replaced the `javax` namespace with `jakarta`.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Identify the import statement that needs to be replaced. In this case, it's `import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;` and `import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;`.\n2. Replace `javax.ws` with `jakarta.ws` in the import statements.\n3. Update the import statements to `import jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;` and `import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;`.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.rest;\n\nimport jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;\nimport jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;\n\n/**\n * Rest Application\n */\n@ApplicationPath(\"/services\")\npublic class RestApplication extends Application {\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nTo complete this migration, the following changes should be made to the `pom.xml` file:\n\n* Update the `javaee-api` dependency to `jakarta.xml.bind-api` and `jakarta.ws.rs-api` (if not already done).\n* Update the `maven-compiler-plugin` to use the correct Java version (if not already done).\n* Update any other dependencies that rely on the `javax` namespace to use the `jakarta` namespace instead.\n\nNote: The exact changes to the `pom.xml` file will depend on the specific project configuration and dependencies.",
