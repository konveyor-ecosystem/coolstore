["1. **Issue 1 and 2:** The Java EE packages have been migrated to Jakarta EE and the package names have changed from `javax.ws` to `jakarta.ws`. This is a breaking change and needs to be addressed. Quarkus is built on top of Jakarta EE, so we need to update our imports accordingly.\n\n2. **Issue 3 and 4:** In Quarkus, JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary. The `@ApplicationPath` and `extends Application` are not needed in Quarkus. Instead, we can set a root path in the `application.properties` file. However, since the input file only sets a root path and does not implement any functionality, we can safely remove these lines."]
