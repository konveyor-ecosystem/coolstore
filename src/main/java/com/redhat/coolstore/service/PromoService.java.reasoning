["The main issue identified was the import statement for `javax.enterprise`. In Quarkus, the older `javax.*` packages are replaced by the `jakarta.*` packages. Therefore, the `javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped` import statement needs to be replaced with `jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped`.\n\nOther than this, the code seems compatible with Quarkus. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is used to define a bean that is instantiated once and shared across the application. This is supported by Quarkus and the bean will be lazy-loaded by default i.e., it will be created only when an invocation is made on it.\n\nThe use of the `Serializable` interface indicates that instances of `PromoService` can be serialized and deserialized. This is also supported in Quarkus.\n\nThe rest of the code is mostly business logic that manipulates the `ShoppingCart` and `Promotion` objects, and I don't see any other aspects that would need to be changed for compatibility with Quarkus."]
