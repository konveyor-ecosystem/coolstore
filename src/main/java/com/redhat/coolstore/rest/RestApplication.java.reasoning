["The first two issues are about the import statements. In Quarkus, the `javax.ws.rs` package has been replaced with `jakarta.ws.rs`. So, we need to replace the `javax.ws.rs` import statements with `jakarta.ws.rs`.\n\nThe third and fourth issues are related to the JAX-RS activation. In Quarkus, the JAX-RS activation is not necessary, as Quarkus automatically activates JAX-RS for us. In this case, we can remove the `@ApplicationPath` annotation and the `RestApplication` class, which extends `Application`, because they are not needed in Quarkus. \n\nHowever, if we want to set a root path for our JAX-RS application, we can do it by setting the `quarkus.resteasy.path` property in the `application.properties` file. \n\nAlso, it's important to note that the migration from Java EE to Quarkus may require updates to the `pom.xml` file to include Quarkus dependencies. In this case, the `quarkus-resteasy` dependency should be included, which provides JAX-RS capabilities in Quarkus."]
