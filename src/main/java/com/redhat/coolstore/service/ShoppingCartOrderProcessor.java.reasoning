["1. The primary issue identified is the use of `javax.annotation`, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.annotation` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus.\n2. We will update the import statements in the file to reflect the correct package.\n3. As Quarkus is more lightweight and relies heavily on CDI for dependency injection, we will also remove the `@Stateless` annotation and handle the bean instantiation differently.\n4. We will update the `@Inject` annotation to use the Quarkus equivalent for dependency injection.", "1. The first step is to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb` as required by the Quarkus framework.\n2. We also need to ensure that the `@Resource` annotation is correctly imported from `jakarta.annotation`.\n3. Since Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection, we need to replace the `@Inject` annotation with `@javax.inject.Inject`.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis states that the import statements for javax.inject should be replaced with jakarta.inject due to the Jakarta EE to Jakarta EE namespace change.\n2. We need to update the import statements for `javax.inject.Inject` to `jakarta.inject.Inject`.\n3. We also need to update the import statements for `javax.annotation.Resource` to `jakarta.annotation.Resource`.", "1. The issue found in the static code analysis is that the `javax.jms` import statements need to be updated to `jakarta.jms` to migrate the code to Quarkus.\n2. The `jakarta.inject.Inject` and `jakarta.annotation.Resource` imports do not need to be updated as they are already part of Jakarta EE specifications.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.jms` import statement with `jakarta.jms`.\n2. In Quarkus, the Jakarta EE APIs have been migrated to the `jakarta.*` namespace, so we need to update the import statements accordingly.\n3. We will replace the `jakarta.inject.Inject` import statement for CDI injection. \n4. We will also update the `jakarta.annotation.Resource` import statement for resource injection.", "1. The static code analysis has identified that JMS `Topic`s should be replaced with Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel in Quarkus.\n2. In the provided Java EE file, the `ordersTopic` field is declared as a JMS `Topic`.\n3. To migrate this to Quarkus, we need to replace the JMS `Topic` with an `Emitter` feeding a Channel.\n4. We will update the `ordersTopic` field to be an `Emitter<String>` and inject it with the `@Channel` annotation.\n5. We will also update the imports to use the corresponding Quarkus annotations and classes.", "1. The issue found in the static code analysis is related to replacing JMS `Topic`s with Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel.\n2. In the provided Java EE code, the `Emitter` is already being used. We need to ensure that the `Emitter` is correctly defined and used.\n3. We will need to update the injection of `ordersEmitter` to use `@Inject` instead of `@Resource`.\n4. We will replace the JMS `orders` topic with a Micrometer `Emitter` feeding a channel.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is the use of `JMSContext` which is a Java EE/Jakarta EE element. To migrate to Quarkus, we need to replace it with its Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalent.\n2. In Quarkus, the equivalent for JMS messaging is using SmallRye Reactive Messaging. We will replace the usage of `JMSContext` with `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Message`.\n3. We will also need to update the imports to include the necessary classes for SmallRye Reactive Messaging.", "1. Replace the import statement for JMS related classes with SmallRye Reactive Messaging equivalents.\n2. Update the injection of JMSContext with Message from SmallRye Reactive Messaging.\n3. Replace the usage of JMSContext with Message in the code.\n4. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are added to the pom.xml file for SmallRye Reactive Messaging.", "1. The issue found in the static code analysis is that the `@Stateless` annotation needs to be replaced with a CDI scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped` when migrating from Java EE to Quarkus.\n2. In this case, the `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` class is a CDI bean that can be scoped with `@ApplicationScoped`.\n3. The imports for `Message` and `Emitter` need to be updated to use the SmallRye Reactive Messaging annotations for Quarkus.\n4. The `JMSContext` injection has been replaced with `Message` injection for SmallRye Reactive Messaging in Quarkus."]
