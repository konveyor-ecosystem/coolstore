## Reasoning

To migrate the `RestApplication.java` file to Quarkus, we need to address the issues highlighted in the static source code analysis.

**Issue 1 and 2:** The `javax.ws` import statements need to be replaced with `jakarta.ws`. This is because Quarkus uses Jakarta EE, which has a different namespace than Java EE. We can simply update the import statements to use the correct namespace.

**Issue 3 and 4:** The JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary in Quarkus. We can remove the `@ApplicationPath` annotation and the `extends Application` clause, as they are not required in Quarkus.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Update the import statements to use `jakarta.ws` instead of `javax.ws`.
2. Remove the `@ApplicationPath` annotation, as it's not necessary in Quarkus.
3. Remove the `extends Application` clause, as it's not necessary in Quarkus.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;

public class RestApplication {

}
```

## Additional Information

To complete this migration, we need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary Quarkus dependencies. Specifically, we need to add the `quarkus-resteasy` dependency to enable JAX-RS support in Quarkus.

We also need to ensure that the `jakarta.ws.rs` API is imported in the `pom.xml` file, as it's required for the updated import statements.
