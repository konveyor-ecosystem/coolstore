### incident 0

 incident to fix: "Replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb` "
 Line number: 6

### incident 1

incident to fix: "Replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb` "
 Line number: 7

### incident 2

incident to fix: "Remote EJBs are not supported in Quarkus, and therefore its use must be removed and replaced with REST functionality. In order to do this:
 1. Replace the `@Remote` annotation on the class with a `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path(&#34;&lt;endpoint&gt;&#34;)` annotation. An endpoint must be added to the annotation in place of `&lt;endpoint&gt;` to specify the actual path to the REST service.
 2. Remove `@Stateless` annotations if present. Given that REST services are stateless by nature, it makes it unnecessary.
 3. For every public method on the EJB being converted, do the following:
 - Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.GET`
 - Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path(&#34;&lt;endpoint&gt;&#34;)` and give it a proper endpoint path. As a rule of thumb, the method name can be used as endpoint, for instance:
 ```
 @Path(&#34;/increment&#34;)
 public void increment() 
 ```
 - Add `@jakarta.ws.rs.QueryParam(&#34;&lt;param-name&gt;&#34;)` to any method parameters if needed, where `&lt;param-name&gt;` is a name for the parameter."

### incident 3
