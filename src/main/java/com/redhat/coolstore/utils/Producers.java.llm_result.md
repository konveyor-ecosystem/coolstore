## Reasoning

The first two issues are straightforward. We need to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statements with `jakarta.enterprise` because Quarkus uses Jakarta EE APIs instead of the older Java EE APIs.

The third issue is a bit more complex. In Quarkus, we can skip the `@Produces` annotation if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier. In this case, we can replace the `@Produces` annotation with a `@Singleton` annotation, which is a scope annotation. This means that the `produceLog` method will be called once and the produced `Logger` will be reused for all injections.

We also need to add a `@Named` annotation to the `produceLog` method. This will allow us to inject the `Logger` by name in other classes.

Finally, we need to import the `javax.inject.Singleton` and `javax.inject.Named` annotations.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
import java.util.logging.Logger;
import javax.inject.Singleton;
import javax.inject.Named;

public class Producers {

    Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());

    @Singleton
    @Named("logger")
    public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

After updating the `Producers` class, you need to update all classes that inject the `Logger` produced by the `produceLog` method. You need to replace the `@Inject` annotation with the `@Named("logger")` annotation. For example:

```java
@Named("logger")
private Logger log;
```

This will inject the `Logger` produced by the `produceLog` method.
