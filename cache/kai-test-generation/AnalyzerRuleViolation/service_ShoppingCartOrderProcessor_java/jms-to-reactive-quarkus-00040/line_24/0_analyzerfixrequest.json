      "content": "## Reasoning\n\nThe issue described is related to the replacement of JMS `Topic`s with Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel. However, the provided code already uses `Emitter` and `@Channel` annotation, which seems to be the correct approach for Quarkus.\n\nUpon closer inspection, the issue seems to be related to the fact that the `@Channel` annotation is used directly on the field, whereas the example provided in the issue suggests using `@Inject` along with `@Channel`.\n\nHowever, in Quarkus, it's common to use `@Inject` along with `@Channel` when using the `@Channel` annotation on a method parameter or a constructor parameter, not directly on a field.\n\nGiven the provided code, it seems that the issue might be related to the fact that the `@Channel` annotation is not being used correctly, or there might be some other configuration issue that's not apparent from the provided code.\n\nHowever, to follow the instructions and make the change as suggested, we can add the `@Inject` annotation along with `@Channel` to see if it resolves the issue.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport io.quarkus.arc.Singleton;\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Channel;\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Emitter;\nimport javax.inject.Inject;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@Singleton\npublic class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {\n\n    @Inject\n    @Channel(\"orders-topic\")\n    Emitter<String> ordersTopic;\n\n    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {\n        ordersTopic.send(Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\n\nNo additional changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this update. The `@Inject` annotation is part of the Java EE standard and is already included in the Quarkus dependencies.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that the `@Inject` annotation is not strictly necessary in this case, as Quarkus will automatically inject the `Emitter` instance even without the `@Inject` annotation. The `@Inject` annotation is more commonly used when injecting instances into methods or constructors.",
