This is because the `@Stateless` annotation is being used, which is part of the EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans) API. In Jakarta EE 9 and later, the package names for the EJB API have been changed from `javax.ejb` to `jakarta.ejb`.\n\nHere are the steps to update the code:\n\n1. Replace the import statement `import javax.ejb.Stateless;` with `import jakarta.ejb.Stateless;`.\n2. No changes are required to the `@Stateless` annotation itself, as the annotation name remains the same.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\nimport jakarta.ejb.Stateless;\nimport javax.annotation.Resource;\nimport javax.inject.Inject;\nimport javax.jms.JMSContext;\nimport javax.jms.Topic;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@Stateless\npublic class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n\n    @Inject\n    private transient JMSContext context;\n\n    @Resource(lookup = \"java:/topic/orders\")\n    private Topic ordersTopic;\n\n    \n  \n    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {\n        log.info(\"Sending order from processor: \");\n        context.createProducer().send(ordersTopic, Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));\n    }\n\n\n\n}\n\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNo additional changes are required to the `pom.xml` file or other dependencies at this time. However, it's worth noting that when migrating to Jakarta EE 9 or later, you may need to update the `pom.xml` file to use the Jakarta EE 9 or later BOM (Bill of Materials) and update the dependencies accordingly.",
