The issue mentioned is related to the unnecessary use of `@Produces` annotation in Quarkus when the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier.\n2. In this case, the `produceLog` method is not annotated with any of the mentioned annotations, so we can remove the `@Produces` annotation.\n3. Instead of using the `@Produces` annotation, we can create a getter method annotated with `@Named` to access the `Logger` field.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport jakarta.inject.Named;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class Producers {\n\n    Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());\n\n    @Named\n    public Logger getLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {\n        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNo additional steps are required for this specific issue.",
