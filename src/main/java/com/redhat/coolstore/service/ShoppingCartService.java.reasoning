["1. **Issue 1:** The first issue to address is the use of `javax.ejb` import statement. Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which uses the `jakarta` package namespace instead of `javax`. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** Similarly, the second issue to address is the use of `javax.inject` import statement. We need to replace it with `jakarta.inject` to follow the Jakarta EE specification.\n\n3. **Stateful Session Bean:** Quarkus does not support EJBs, so we need to replace the `@Stateful` annotation with a Quarkus-specific annotation or implement an alternative solution for session management. In this case, we can use a CDI-managed bean with the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation, which provides a similar behavior to the `@Stateful` annotation.\n\n4. **JNDI Lookup:** Quarkus does not support JNDI lookups. Instead, we can use CDI injection to inject the required dependencies. In this case, we can inject the `ShippingServiceRemote` interface directly into the `ShoppingCartService` class.\n\n5. **External Dependencies:** We need to remove the `pom.xml` dependencies related to Java EE, such as `javaee-api`, and add the required Quarkus dependencies, such as `quarkus-resteasy-mutiny` and `quarkus-jdbc-client`.\n\n6. **Imports:** We need to update the imports to use the Quarkus-specific packages, such as `jakarta.inject` instead of `javax.inject`."]
