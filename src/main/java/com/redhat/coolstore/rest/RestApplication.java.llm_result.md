## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 and 2:** The Java EE specification has been updated to Jakarta EE, which includes changes to package names. The `javax.ws.rs` package is now `jakarta.ws.rs` in Jakarta EE. Since Quarkus is built on top of Jakarta EE, we need to update our imports accordingly.

2. **Issue 3 and 4:** In Quarkus, JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary, and the root path can be set directly on the endpoint classes. In this case, the `@ApplicationPath` annotation is not needed, and the root path can be set using the `@Path` annotation on the endpoint classes. However, since this is an empty application class that extends `Application`, we can remove it entirely.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

// No imports needed

// public class RestApplication extends Application {
// }
```

## Additional Information

Since we have removed the `RestApplication` class, we need to update our `pom.xml` file to reflect this change. We can remove the `<scope>provided</scope>` from the `jakarta.platform-maven-plugin` configuration, as we no longer have a JAX-RS application class.

Additionally, we need to add our REST endpoints to the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file to set the root path. For example, if we have a `GreetingResource` class, we can set the root path like this:

```
quarkus.resteasy.root-path=/services
```

This will set the root path for all REST endpoints to `/services`. If we want to set a different root path for a specific endpoint, we can use the `@Path` annotation on that endpoint class. For example, if we want to set the root path for the `GreetingResource` class to `/hello`, we can do this:

```java
@Path("/hello")
public class GreetingResource {
    // ...
}
```

This will set the root path for the `GreetingResource` class to `/services/hello`.
