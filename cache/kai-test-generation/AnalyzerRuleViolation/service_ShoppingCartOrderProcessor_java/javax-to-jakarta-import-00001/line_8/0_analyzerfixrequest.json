However, upon reviewing the provided code, there is no `javax.jms` import statement present. \n\nInstead, the code uses `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging` package which is not related to the `javax.jms` or `jakarta.jms` packages. The `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging` package is used for reactive messaging in SmallRye, a set of Eclipse MicroProfile implementations.\n\nSince there is no `javax.jms` import statement to replace, no changes are required in the provided code.\n\nHowever, if the intention is to migrate the code to use Jakarta EE's JMS API, then the necessary changes would involve replacing the `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging` package with the `jakarta.jms` package, and updating the code to use the Jakarta EE's JMS API.\n\nBut based on the provided information, no changes are required.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Channel;\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Emitter;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@ApplicationScoped\npublic class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {\n\n    @Inject\n    @Channel(\"orders-topic\")\n    Emitter<String> ordersTopic;\n\n    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {\n        ordersTopic.send(Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\n\nNo additional changes are required in the `pom.xml` file or imports as there are no changes made to the code.",
