The issue found from static code analysis is that the import statement `javax.enterprise` needs to be replaced with `jakarta.enterprise` in order to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. We need to update the import statement for `Produces` and `InjectionPoint` to use the `jakarta.enterprise` package.\n3. The rest of the code should remain unchanged as it is compatible with Quarkus.", "1. The issue found in the static code analysis mentions that in Quarkus, we can skip the @Produces annotation if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. Therefore, we need to remove the @Produces annotation from the method.\n2. The Logger field in the Producers class should be accessed using a @Named getter method instead of directly accessing it. We will update the field to be private and create a getter method annotated with @Named to access it."]
