["1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the `javax.annotation` import statements need to be replaced with `jakarta.annotation` to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. We need to update the import statements for `PostConstruct` and `Resource` annotations from `javax.annotation` to `jakarta.annotation`.\n3. Since Quarkus uses CDI instead of EJB, we need to remove the `javax.ejb` annotations and replace them with CDI annotations.\n4. We should update the `@Inject` annotation to use the `javax.inject` package.\n5. We will update the Flyway configuration to work with Quarkus.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the import statements for `javax.annotation` need to be replaced with `jakarta.annotation` as Quarkus uses Jakarta EE APIs instead of Java EE APIs.\n2. Since Quarkus is a lightweight and fast framework, we can remove the `jakarta.transaction.Transactional` annotation as it is not needed in Quarkus.\n3. Quarkus does not use `@Singleton` annotation for managing beans, instead, it relies on CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection). We will remove the `@Singleton` annotation.\n4. Update the import statements for `DataSource` to use the correct Quarkus implementation.\n5. Update the `@Inject` annotation to `@javax.inject.Inject` as Quarkus uses this package for dependency injection.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`.\n2. In the provided Java EE code, the imports for `jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct` and `jakarta.annotation.Resource` are already correctly used, so no changes are needed there.\n3. The `@Inject` annotation is used from `javax.inject`, which is still valid in Quarkus and does not need to be changed.\n4. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is from `javax.enterprise.context`, which also does not need to be changed.\n5. The `@Resource(lookup = \"java:/jboss/datasources/CoolstoreDS\")` annotation is correctly used from `jakarta.annotation.Resource`.", "1. The static code analysis identified the issue of using `javax.ejb` import statement, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ejb` to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. The `jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct` annotation is used in Quarkus to define a method to be invoked immediately after the bean is initialized, so it should be imported from `jakarta.annotation` package.\n3. The `@Resource` annotation is used to inject a DataSource in Quarkus, so it should be imported from `jakarta.annotation` package.\n4. The `@Inject` annotation is used for dependency injection in Quarkus, so it should be imported from `javax.inject` package.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the `javax.ejb` import statement needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ejb` to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. The `@Resource` annotation from `javax.annotation` package also needs to be replaced with `jakarta.annotation` in order to migrate to Quarkus.\n3. Since Quarkus is a lightweight and fast framework, we no longer need the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation because Quarkus provides CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) by default.\n4. We need to update the `@Inject` annotation to `@Inject` from `javax.inject` package to `@javax.inject.Inject` to align with Quarkus requirements.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`.\n2. The `jakarta` namespace is used in Quarkus instead of the old `javax` namespace.\n3. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.", "1. The issue found in the static code analysis is to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`.\n2. To address this issue, we need to update the import statement for `Inject` in the code.\n3. Additionally, we need to make sure that all other Jakarta EE dependencies are updated to their respective Quarkus equivalents."]
