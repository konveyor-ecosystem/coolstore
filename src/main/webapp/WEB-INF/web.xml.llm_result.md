## Reasoning

1. Reviewing the session replication usage in the provided `web.xml` file indicates that session replication is currently enabled through the `<distributable>` tag.
2. However, as mentioned in the issue description, session replication may not be the best option for cloud environments where data in memory can be wiped out by a restart.
3. To address this, we can consider disabling HTTP session clustering and accept its implications, or re-architecting the application to store sessions in a cache backing service or a remote data grid.
4. In the context of migrating to Quarkus, we can leverage its support for various data grids such as Infinispan, Hazelcast, and Apache Ignite.
5. In this step, we will disable HTTP session clustering by removing the `<distributable>` tag from the `web.xml` file.
6. In subsequent steps, we can explore the option of integrating a remote data grid with Quarkus.

## Updated File

```xml

<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd"
         version="3.0">
    <!-- Removed <distributable> tag to disable session replication -->
</web-app>
```

## Additional Information

1. After removing the `<distributable>` tag, we will need to update the `pom.xml` file to remove any dependencies related to session replication.
2. In the next steps, we can explore integrating a remote data grid with Quarkus. This will involve adding the appropriate extension and configuration to the `application.properties` file.
3. We will also need to update the application code to use the chosen data grid for session storage. This may involve using a different session management API and updating the imports accordingly.
