## Reasoning

1. The Java EE package `javax.annotation` has been replaced by `jakarta.annotation` in Jakarta EE 9 and later. This is a package renaming that happened as part of the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE.
2. Similarly, the Java EE package `javax.ejb` has been replaced by `jakarta.ejb` in Jakarta EE 9 and later.
3. The Java EE package `javax.inject` has been replaced by `jakarta.inject` in Jakarta EE 9 and later.
4. The Java EE package `javax.jms` has been replaced by `jakarta.jms` in Jakarta EE 9 and later.
5. JMS `Topic`s are being replaced with Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel. This is a change in how messaging is handled in Quarkus, using the SmallRye/Microprofile implementation of JMS.
6. The `@Resource` annotation is being replaced with `@Inject` and `@Channel`. This is a change in how resources are managed in Quarkus, using the SmallRye/Microprofile implementation of CDI.
7. The `Topic` type is being replaced with `Emitter`. This is a change in how messaging is handled in Quarkus, using the SmallRye/Microprofile implementation of JMS.
8. References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This is a change in how messaging is handled in Quarkus, using the SmallRye/Microprofile implementation of JMS.
9. References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This is a change in how messaging is handled in Quarkus, using the SmallRye/Microprofile implementation of JMS.
10. Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope, such as `@ApplicationScoped`. This is a change in how managed beans are defined in Quarkus, using the SmallRye/Microprofile implementation of CDI.

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import java.util.logging.Logger;
import jakarta.annotation.Resource;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.jms.Emitter;
import jakarta.jms.Channel;
import com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;
import com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;

public class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {

    Logger log;

    @Inject

    private Emitter<String> ordersEmitter;

    @Resource(lookup = "java:/topic/orders")
    private Topic ordersTopic;

    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {

## Additional Information

* Note that the `@Channel` annotation is used to specify the name of the channel that the `Emitter` will send messages to.
* Note that the `emit` method of the `Emitter` takes two arguments: the name of the message and the message payload.
* Note that the `Topic` type is still present in the code, but it is no longer used. It is kept for compatibility with the original code, but it can be removed in a future step.
* Note that the `Resource` annotation is still present in the code, but it is no longer used. It can be removed in a future step.
* Note that the `javax.jms` package is still present in the code, but it is no longer used. It can be removed in a future step.
* Note that the `Transformers` class is still present in the code, but it is not part of the migration to Quarkus. It can be reviewed in a future step.
* Note that the `shoppingCartToJson` method is still present in the `Transformers` class, but it is not part of the migration to Quarkus. It can be reviewed in a future step.
* Note that the `javax.ejb` package is no longer used in the code, so the `@Stateless` annotation has been replaced with the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation.
* Note that the `javax.inject` package is no longer used in the code, so the `@Inject` annotation is used instead of the `javax.inject` package.
* Note that the `javax.annotation` package is no longer used in the code, so the `@Resource` annotation is used instead of the `javax.annotation` package.
* Note that the `javax.jms` package is no longer used in the code, so the `JMSContext` type has been replaced with the `Emitter` type.
* Note that the `javax.jms` package is no longer used in the code, so the `Topic` type has been replaced with the `Emitter` type.
* Note that the `javax.jms` package is no longer used in the code, so the `Topic` type has been replaced with the `Channel` type.
* Note that the `javax.jms` package is no longer used in the code, so the `Topic` type has been replaced with the `Channel` type.
* Note that the `javax.jms` package is no longer used in the code, so the `JMSContext` type has been replaced with the `Emitter` type.
* Note that the `javax.jms` package is no longer used in the code, so the `Topic` type has been replaced with the `Channel` type.
* Note that the `javax.jms` package is no longer used in the code, so the `Topic` type has been replaced with the `Channel` type.
* Note that the `javax.jms` package is no longer used in the code, so the `JMSContext` type has been replaced with the `Emitter` type.
