## Reasoning

The issue highlighted is related to session replication in a distributed environment. In a traditional Java EE environment, session replication is often handled by the application server. However, in a cloud-native environment like Quarkus, this is not the case. 

Quarkus does not support session replication out of the box. Instead, it encourages stateless applications or externalizing session state to a distributed data grid or cache. 

In this case, the web.xml file is configuring the application to be distributable, which is a directive for the application server to replicate sessions. Since Quarkus does not support this, the directive is not needed and the web.xml file can be removed.

Quarkus does not use a web.xml file for configuration. Instead, it uses application.properties file for configuration. If session replication is needed, it can be achieved using an extension like Infinispan, which provides a distributed data grid.

## Updated File

```xml
<!-- The web.xml file is not needed in Quarkus and can be removed. -->
```

## Additional Information (optional)

If session replication is needed, consider using an extension like Infinispan. This will require adding the Infinispan extension to your pom.xml file and configuring it in the application.properties file. 

For example, to add the Infinispan extension, you would add the following to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-infinispan-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

And to configure Infinispan, you would add something like the following to your application.properties file:

```properties
quarkus.infinispan-client.server-list=192.168.1.106:11222
quarkus.infinispan-client.auth-username=my_username
quarkus.infinispan-client.auth-password=my_password
quarkus.infinispan-client.sasl-mechanism=DIGEST-MD5
quarkus.infinispan-client.trust-store=/path/to/truststore.jks
quarkus.infinispan-client.trust-store-password=changeit
```

This is just an example and the actual configuration will depend on your specific needs and environment.
