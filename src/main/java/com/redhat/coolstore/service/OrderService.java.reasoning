["In order to migrate this Java EE code to Quarkus, we need to address a few issues:\n\n1. The first issue is related to the import statements which need to be updated from `javax.ejb`, `javax.inject`, and `javax.persistence` to their Jakarta equivalents. This is because Jakarta EE is the new namespace for Java EE classes.\n\n2. The second issue is related to the `EntityManager` injection. In Quarkus, we don't need to use `@Produces` to create an `EntityManager` bean as it's created automatically by configuring the datasource. We can directly inject the `EntityManager` using the `@Inject` annotation.\n\n3. The third issue is related to the Stateless EJBs. In Quarkus, we can replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped` to convert the Stateless EJBs to a CDI bean."]
