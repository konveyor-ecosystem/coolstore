["1. The static code analysis has highlighted the issue of replacing the `javax.json` import statement with `jakarta.json`.\n2. We need to update the imports in the file to reflect the changes required for Quarkus migration.\n3. We will replace all occurrences of `javax.json` imports with `jakarta.json`.\n4. We will update the import statements in the file accordingly.", "1. The issue found in the static code analysis is to replace the `javax.json` import statements with `jakarta.json`.\n2. Quarkus follows the Jakarta EE standards, which have been migrated to the Jakarta namespace.\n3. We need to update the import statements for `Json`, `JsonArray`, `JsonArrayBuilder`, `JsonObject`, `JsonReader`, and `JsonWriter` from `javax.json` to `jakarta.json`.\n4. Additionally, we need to update the package name from `javax.json` to `jakarta.json` in the import statements.", "1. The static code analysis identified that the import statements for `javax.json` need to be replaced with `jakarta.json` to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. As Quarkus is based on Jakarta EE, the `jakarta.json` package should be used instead of `javax.json`.\n3. We will update the import statements in the file to reflect this change.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the `javax.json` import statements need to be replaced with `jakarta.json`.\n2. Since Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE standards, we need to update the import statements to use `jakarta.json` instead of `javax.json`.\n3. We will update all the import statements related to `jakarta.json` to comply with the Jakarta EE standards.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the `javax.json` import statements need to be replaced with `jakarta.json` to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. The `jakarta.json` package is the Jakarta EE version of the `javax.json` package, as Jakarta EE is the successor of Java EE.\n3. We will need to update the import statements for `Json`, `JsonArray`, `JsonArrayBuilder`, `JsonObject`, `JsonReader`, and `JsonWriter` to use the `jakarta.json` package.\n4. The rest of the code logic should remain the same as we are only addressing the import statement change.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.json` imports with `jakarta.json`.\n2. Quarkus uses `jakarta.json` instead of `javax.json`, so we need to update the import statements in the file.\n3. We will replace all the `javax.json` imports with `jakarta.json` to make the code compatible with Quarkus."]
