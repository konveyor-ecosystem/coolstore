I will give you a JavaEE file for which I want to take one step towards migrating to Quarkus.

I will provide you with static source code analysis information highlighting an issue which needs to be addressed.

I will also provide you with an example of how a similar issue was solved in the past via a solved example.

You can refer to the solved example for a pattern of how to update the input Java EE file to Quarkus.

Fix only the problem described. Other problems will be solved in subsequent steps so it is unnecessary to handle them now.

Before attempting to migrate the code to Quarkus reason through what changes are required and why.

Pay attention to changes you make and impacts to external dependencies in the pom.xml as well as changes to imports we need to consider.

As you make changes that impact the pom.xml or imports, be sure you explain what needs to be updated.

After you have shared your step by step thinking, provide a full output of the updated file.

## Issues

### Issue 1
Issue to fix: "Replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb` "
Line number: 6
### Issue 2
Issue to fix: "Replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb` "
Line number: 7
### Issue 3
Issue to fix: "Remote EJBs are not supported in Quarkus, and therefore its use must be removed and replaced with REST functionality. In order to do this:
 1. Replace the `@Remote` annotation on the class with a `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path("<endpoint>")` annotation. An endpoint must be added to the annotation in place of `<endpoint>` to specify the actual path to the REST service.
 2. Remove `@Stateless` annotations if present. Given that REST services are stateless by nature, it makes it unnecessary.
 3. For every public method on the EJB being converted, do the following:
 - Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.GET`
 - Annotate the method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path("<endpoint>")` and give it a proper endpoint path. As a rule of thumb, the method name can be used as endpoint, for instance:
 ```
 @Path("/increment")
 public void increment() 
 ```
 - Add `@jakarta.ws.rs.QueryParam("<param-name>")` to any method parameters if needed, where `<param-name>` is a name for the parameter."

### Issue 4
Issue to fix: "Stateless EJBs can be converted to a cdi bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope eg `@ApplicationScoped`
