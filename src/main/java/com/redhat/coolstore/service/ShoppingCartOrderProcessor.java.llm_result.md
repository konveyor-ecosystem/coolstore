## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1:** Java EE and Jakarta EE use different packages for annotations. Java EE uses `javax.annotation` while Jakarta EE and Quarkus use `jakarta.annotation`. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus.

2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, EJBs are replaced by CDI in Quarkus. The `@Stateless` annotation is replaced by a CDI scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`.

3. **Issue 3:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.inject` package is replaced by `jakarta.inject` in Quarkus.

4. **Issue 4:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.jms` package is replaced by `jakarta.jms` in Quarkus.

5. **Issue 5:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.jms` package is replaced by `jakarta.jms` in Quarkus.

6. **Issue 6:** Quarkus uses Micrometer for metrics and tracing. Topics are replaced by Emitters and Channels. The `Topic` is injected with `@Channel` and the `@Resource` annotation is not needed.

7. **Issue 7:** Similar to Issue 6, the `Topic` is replaced by an `Emitter` and `@Resource` is replaced by `@Channel`.

8. **Issue 8:** Quarkus uses SmallRye and MicroProfile for JMS. The JMS `Topic` is replaced by an `Emitter` and `@Resource` is replaced by `@Channel`.

9. **Issue 9:** Similar to Issue 8, the JMS `Topic` is replaced by an `Emitter` and `@Resource` is replaced by `@Channel`.

10. **Issue 10:** Similar to Issue 2, the `@Stateless` annotation is replaced by a CDI scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import java.util.logging.Logger;
import jakarta.annotation.Resource;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.jms.JMSContext;
import jakarta.jms.Emitter;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;
import com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;

@ApplicationScoped
public class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "orders.topic")
    private Emitter<String> ordersEmitter;

    @Resource(name = "mp:/jms-resource/java:/jms/cf/my-connection-factory")
    private JMSContext context;

    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {
        log.info("Sending order from processor: ");
        ordersEmitter.emit(Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

The `@ConfigProperty` annotation is used to inject configuration properties from the application configuration file. In this example, the topic name is injected from the `application.properties` file.

The `JMSContext` is injected using a connection factory. The connection factory is configured in the `application.properties` file.

The `Transformers` class is not part of the input file, but it is assumed to be available in the Quarkus project. If it is not available, it needs to be added to the project.
