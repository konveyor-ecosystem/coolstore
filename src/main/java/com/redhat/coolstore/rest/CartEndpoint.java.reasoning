["1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the import statement `javax.enterprise` needs to be replaced with `jakarta.enterprise` to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. In Quarkus, the namespace has been changed from `javax` to `jakarta` due to the rebranding of Java EE to Jakarta EE.\n3. We need to update the import statements throughout the file to use `jakarta.enterprise` instead of `javax.enterprise`.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the import statement for `javax.inject` needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject` in order to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. Since Quarkus is based on Jakarta EE specifications, it is necessary to update the import statements to use the Jakarta EE namespace.\n3. The `SessionScoped` annotation is also part of Jakarta EE and does not need to be changed.\n4. All other annotations like `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, `Path`, and `Produces` are part of JAX-RS and can remain unchanged.\n5. The `ShoppingCartService` class and other dependencies should still work in Quarkus without any modifications.\n6. The code logic and structure can remain the same, only the necessary import statement needs to be updated.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`.\n2. We need to update all `javax.ws` imports to `jakarta.ws` to migrate the code to Quarkus.\n3. Update the import statements in the file to use `jakarta.ws` instead of `javax.ws`.\n4. Update the imports in the `pom.xml` file to include any new dependencies required for Quarkus.", "1. The primary issue identified is the import statements using `jakarta.ws` instead of `javax.ws`. For Quarkus migration, we need to replace all occurrences of `javax.ws` with `jakarta.ws`.\n2. Since Quarkus uses MicroProfile, we need to update the imports for annotations like `@Path`, `@GET`, `@POST`, `@DELETE`, `@Produces`, and `@PathParam` to use the MicroProfile equivalents.\n3. The scope annotation `@SessionScoped` needs to be replaced with `@SessionScoped` from `jakarta.enterprise.context` package.", "1. The issue found in the static code analysis is that the import statements use `javax.ws` instead of `jakarta.ws`. This needs to be fixed for the Quarkus migration.\n2. We will need to update all the import statements that use `javax.ws` to `jakarta.ws`.\n3. The annotations used for defining endpoints and HTTP methods remain the same in Quarkus, so those don't need to be changed.\n4. Quarkus does not require the `@SessionScoped` annotation, so we can remove that.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the import statements for `javax.ws` need to be replaced with `jakarta.ws` in order to migrate the Java EE code to Quarkus.\n2. The `@Inject` annotation is used for dependency injection in Java EE, which needs to be replaced with `@javax.inject.Inject` in Quarkus.\n3. The annotations for JAX-RS endpoints like `@GET`, `@POST`, `@DELETE`, `@Path`, and `@Produces` need to be replaced with their Quarkus equivalents.\n4. Some annotations related to MicroProfile OpenAPI are used, which can be kept as is since Quarkus also supports MicroProfile.\n5. The `@PathParam` annotation for method parameters needs to be replaced with `@org.jboss.resteasy.annotations.jaxrs.PathParam` in Quarkus.", "1. Replace the `jakarta.ws` import statements with `jakarta.ws`\n2. Update the injection annotation from `@jakarta.inject.Inject` to `@javax.inject.Inject` as Quarkus uses CDI annotations from `javax` package.\n3. Add the necessary Quarkus dependencies to the `pom.xml` file, like `quarkus-resteasy` for REST services.\n4. Remove the `@Produces` annotation and replace it with `@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)` for each method.\n5. Remove the `@GET`, `@POST`, `@DELETE` annotations and replace them with `@GET`, `@POST`, `@DELETE` from `org.eclipse.microprofile.openapi.annotations.Operation`.\n6. Remove the `@PathParam` annotation and replace it with `@PathParam` from `jakarta.ws.rs`.\n7. Add the `@Path` annotation to each method.", "1. The primary issue to address is to replace the `javax.ws` import statement with `jakarta.ws`.\n2. In Java EE, the annotations are imported from `javax.ws.rs.*`. In Quarkus, the annotations are imported from `jakarta.ws.rs.*`. So, we need to update the import statements accordingly.\n3. We will also update the `@Inject` annotation to `@javax.inject.Inject` as Quarkus still uses the `javax.inject` package.\n4. We will update the JAX-RS annotations like `@GET`, `@POST`, `@DELETE`, `@Path`, and `@Produces` to their corresponding Quarkus annotations which are `@GET`, `@POST`, `@DELETE`, `@Path`, and `@Produces`.", "1. The primary issue identified in the Java EE code is the use of `javax.ws` import statements which need to be replaced with `jakarta.ws` for Quarkus compatibility.\n2. Update the import statements from `javax.ws` to `jakarta.ws` throughout the file.\n3. Remove duplicate `import javax.inject.Inject;` statement.\n4. Update the `@Produces` annotation imports to `import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType` for Quarkus compatibility.\n5. Ensure that the `ShoppingCartService` is properly injected and used in the methods."]
