["1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the import statement for `javax.ejb` needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ejb` to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. Since Quarkus follows the Jakarta EE specifications, it is necessary to update the import statements to reflect the new package structure.\n3. We will update the import statements from `javax.ejb` to `jakarta.ejb` in the given Java EE file.\n4. We will also need to update any dependencies or imports in the pom.xml file that might be affected by this change.", "1. The primary issue to address is replacing the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb` as per the static code analysis finding.\n2. Update the import statements for `ActivationConfigProperty`, `MessageDriven`, `Inject`, `JMSException`, `Message`, `MessageListener`, and `TextMessage` from `jakarta.ejb` package.\n3. Update the import statements for `Transformers` from the appropriate package.\n4. Ensure the dependencies in the `pom.xml` are updated to include the necessary Quarkus dependencies for messaging and CDI.", "1. The issue found in static code analysis is to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE APIs which have been migrated to the jakarta namespace.\n2. We will update the import statements in the file from `jakarta.ejb`, `jakarta.inject`, and `jakarta.jms` to use the jakarta namespace instead of javax.\n3. Since there is no solved example provided, we will update the import statements and leave the rest of the code unchanged for now.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.jms` import statement with `jakarta.jms`. This is necessary because Quarkus is based on the Jakarta EE specification which uses the `jakarta` namespace for APIs.\n2. Update the import statements for `javax.jms` to `jakarta.jms`.\n3. No other major changes are needed as Quarkus supports the Jakarta EE APIs.", "1. The first issue to address is to replace the `javax.jms` import statement with `jakarta.jms`.\n2. Update the `@MessageDriven` annotation `activationConfig` property to use `jakarta.jms.Topic` instead of `jakarta.jms.Topic`.\n3. Since Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection, we can remove the `@Inject` annotations and instead use CDI to inject dependencies.\n4. Update the imports to reflect the changes from `javax` to `jakarta`.\n5. Ensure the necessary Quarkus dependencies are added to the pom.xml file.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the `javax.jms` import statements need to be replaced with `jakarta.jms` as part of migrating from Java EE to Quarkus.\n2. We need to update the import statements for `jakarta.ejb` as well.\n3. The annotations `@MessageDriven` and `@ActivationConfigProperty` remain the same as they are part of the Jakarta EE specification, which Quarkus also supports.\n4. Since Quarkus also supports CDI, we can use `@Inject` annotation instead of declaring `OrderService` and `CatalogService` as fields.", "1. The static code analysis highlighted the issue of replacing the `javax.jms` import statement with `jakarta.jms`.\n2. The `jakarta` namespace is part of the Jakarta EE 9 specifications, which Quarkus supports.\n3. To migrate the Java EE code to Quarkus, we need to update the import statements from `javax.jms` to `jakarta.jms`.", "1. The static analysis issue highlighted that EJBs are not supported in Quarkus and CDI should be used instead. \n2. The `@MessageDriven` annotation should be replaced with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.\n3. We need to update the import statements to use the appropriate Quarkus annotations.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is related to the `@MessageDriven` annotation which is specific to Java EE and needs to be migrated to Quarkus.\n2. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Incoming` annotation from `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging` to handle incoming messages instead of using the `@MessageDriven` annotation.\n3. We need to remove the `@MessageDriven` annotation and update the class to implement the `MessageListener` interface.\n4. We will also make sure to remove any unnecessary imports that are specific to Java EE.", "1. The issue identified is related to the `@MessageDriven` annotation which is used in Java EE for message-driven beans. In Quarkus, we can achieve similar functionality using the `@Incoming` annotation from `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging` which is part of the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification.\n2. To address the issue, we need to remove the `@MessageDriven` annotation and configure the message handler method `onMessage` with the `@Incoming(\"order-queue\")` annotation to specify the queue name.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is related to using the `@MessageDriven` annotation in a Java EE file, which is not needed in Quarkus.\n2. To migrate to Quarkus, we need to remove the `@MessageDriven` annotation and replace it with the `@Incoming(\"order-queue\")` annotation on the `onMessage` method.\n3. We also need to make sure to update the imports in the file to use the appropriate Quarkus annotations.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents.\n2. In Quarkus, the SmallRye Reactive Messaging is commonly used for messaging. We will need to replace the JMS-specific elements with SmallRye equivalents.\n3. The `@Incoming` annotation is used in Quarkus with SmallRye Reactive Messaging to consume messages from a specific channel.\n4. We will update the `OrderServiceMDB` class to utilize SmallRye Reactive Messaging annotations and methods for message consumption.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the code contains references to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements, which need to be replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents.\n2. The `@Incoming` annotation is used to consume messages from a messaging channel in Quarkus using SmallRye Reactive Messaging. We need to replace the JMS elements with SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents.\n3. We will update the `OrderServiceMDB` class to use Quarkus SmallRye Reactive Messaging annotations and remove the JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS references.\n4. We will update the `onMessage` method to use the correct SmallRye Reactive Messaging annotation for consuming messages.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that references to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents.\n2. In the given Java EE code, the `@Incoming` annotation is being used from MicroProfile Reactive Messaging, which is compatible with Quarkus. Therefore, no changes are required for this annotation.\n3. The `@Inject` annotations are used for dependency injection in both Java EE and Quarkus, so no changes are needed for these annotations.\n4. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is also compatible with Quarkus, so it can remain as is in the code.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that references to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents.\n2. In the given Java EE code, the `@Incoming` annotation is used from Microprofile Reactive Messaging which is the equivalent of JMS in Quarkus.\n3. We need to update the import statements to use the Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents for the annotations used.\n4.
