["1. The static code analysis identified the use of `javax.ejb` import statement in the Java EE code, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ejb` for migration to Quarkus.\n2. The `@Stateless` annotation is a Java EE annotation, and the equivalent in Quarkus is `@ApplicationScoped`. We will replace `@Stateless` with `@ApplicationScoped`.\n3. We need to update the import statements for the `EntityManager`, `CriteriaBuilder`, `CriteriaQuery`, and `Root` from `javax.persistence` to `jakarta.persistence` as Quarkus uses Jakarta Persistence API.\n4. The `@Inject` annotation remains the same in Quarkus, so no changes are needed in this case.", "1. The static analysis identified that the import statements are using `javax` instead of `jakarta` which is the new package for Jakarta EE APIs in Quarkus.\n2. We need to update the import statements from `javax.ejb`, `javax.inject`, `javax.persistence`, and `javax.persistence.criteria` to `jakarta.ejb`, `jakarta.inject`, `jakarta.persistence`, and `jakarta.persistence.criteria` respectively.\n3. Since Quarkus is a lightweight and fast framework, we can keep the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation as it is.\n4. The `@Inject` annotation remains unchanged in Quarkus, so we can keep it as it is.", "1. The issue found in the static code analysis is that the import statements are using `javax.persistence` which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.persistence` to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. We will update all the import statements from `javax.persistence` to `jakarta.persistence`.\n3. We will also need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary dependencies for Quarkus.", "1. The issue found in the static code analysis is that the `javax.persistence` import statements need to be replaced with `jakarta.persistence` as Quarkus follows Jakarta EE specifications.\n2. We need to update the import statements for `EntityManager`, `CriteriaBuilder`, `CriteriaQuery`, and `Root` to use `jakarta.persistence` instead of `javax.persistence`.\n3. We also need to ensure that the `pom.xml` file is updated to include the necessary dependencies for Quarkus, such as `quarkus-hibernate-orm` for JPA support.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence` to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. The `jakarta.persistence` package is part of Jakarta EE 9, whereas the `javax.persistence` package is part of Java EE 8.\n3. Quarkus is designed to be compatible with Jakarta EE, hence the need to update the import statements to `jakarta.persistence`.", "1. The issue found in the static code analysis is that the import statements are using `javax.persistence` instead of `jakarta.persistence`. This needs to be fixed to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. In Quarkus, the dependencies and imports have been updated to use the `jakarta` namespace, so we need to update all `javax.persistence` imports to `jakarta.persistence`.", "1. We need to address the issue related to the use of `@Produces` annotation for `EntityManager` in the Java EE code. Since Quarkus automatically handles the creation of the `EntityManager` bean when the datasource is correctly configured, we need to remove the `@Produces` annotation and directly `@Inject` the `EntityManager`.\n\n2. To address the above issue, we will remove the `@Produces` annotation from the `EntityManager` field in the `OrderService` class and replace it with `@Inject`.\n\n3. Additionally, we need to consider creating a qualification for the produced `EntityManager`. We will create an `ExtendedContext` qualifier as suggested.\n\n4. We will update the imports to use the Quarkus equivalents for annotations like `@ApplicationScoped`, `@Inject`, and the new `@ExtendedContext` qualifier.\n\n5. Finally, we will update the `OrderService` class to be compatible with Quarkus.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the `@Stateless` annotation needs to be replaced with a CDI scope annotation, such as `@ApplicationScoped`, in order to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. We need to update the import statement for `ApplicationScoped` to use the Quarkus equivalent.\n3. Since Quarkus uses the MicroProfile specification, we need to ensure that the necessary dependencies are added to the `pom.xml` file."]
