["1. The issue found from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`.\n2. In Quarkus, the package for CDI annotations has been changed from `javax.enterprise` to `jakarta.enterprise`.\n3. We need to update the import statements for `@Dependent` and `@Produces` annotations to use the new package `jakarta.enterprise.context` and `jakarta.enterprise.inject` respectively.\n4. Additionally, we need to make sure that the dependencies in the pom.xml file are updated to reflect the changes from Java EE to Quarkus.", "1. The issue found in the static code analysis is that the import statements are using `javax.enterprise`, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.enterprise` for migrating to Quarkus.\n2. The `@PersistenceContext` annotation is part of the `javax.persistence` package, which is still used in Quarkus, so no change is needed for this annotation.\n3. The class is using `EntityManager` from `javax.persistence`, which is also still used in Quarkus, so no change is needed for this class.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`.\n2. In Quarkus, the package name for JPA annotations has been changed from `javax.persistence` to `jakarta.persistence`. Therefore, we need to update the import statements in the code accordingly.\n3. We need to update the import statement for `javax.persistence.EntityManager` to `jakarta.persistence.EntityManager`.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the import statements are using `javax.persistence` which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.persistence` to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. In Quarkus, the `jakarta.persistence` package should be used instead of `javax.persistence` for JPA related annotations and classes.\n3. We need to update the import statements for `EntityManager` and `PersistenceContext` from `jakarta.persistence` instead of `javax.persistence`.", "1. The issue found in the static code analysis indicates that using `@Produces` annotation for EntityManager is not allowed in Quarkus as it will be automatically created based on the datasource configuration.\n2. To address this issue, we need to remove the `@Produces` annotation for the EntityManager and instead inject it using `@Inject`.\n3. If the producer is still needed, we need to create a qualification for the produced EntityManager and for every injection point of the EntityManager.", "1. The issue identified in the static code analysis is related to the use of the `@Produces` annotation in the Java EE code. In Quarkus, we can skip the `@Produces` annotation if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier.\n2. In this case, the `getEntityManager()` method is annotated with `@Inject`, which is a scope annotation. Therefore, we can remove the `@Produces` annotation from the `getEntityManager()` method.\n3. Instead of using the `@Produces` annotation, we can access the field `em` directly using a `@Named` getter method."]
