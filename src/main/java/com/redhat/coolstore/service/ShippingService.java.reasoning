["1. The issue found from static analysis is that the import statement `javax.ejb` needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ejb` to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. Since Quarkus is based on Jakarta EE specifications, we need to update the import statement to use the new Jakarta namespace.", "1. The issue identified from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`.\n2. The `@Remote` annotation is from the Java EE world and is not part of Quarkus. We can remove this annotation as Quarkus does not require it.\n3. Quarkus uses CDI beans instead of EJBs, so we need to ensure that the dependencies and annotations are updated accordingly.", "1. **Remove `@Stateless` annotation**: Quarkus does not support EJBs, so the `@Stateless` annotation needs to be removed.\n2. **Replace `@Remote` and `@GET` annotations**: Replace `@Remote` with `@Path` and annotate each method with `@GET` and `@Path` to expose them as REST endpoints.\n3. **Add `@QueryParam` annotation**: If needed, add `@QueryParam` annotation to method parameters.\n4. **Remove method visibility modifiers**: In Quarkus, methods in REST endpoints should not have visibility modifiers like `public` or `private`.", "1. The issue identified by the static code analysis is the usage of `@Stateless` annotation, which is a Java EE annotation. To migrate to Quarkus, we need to replace it with a CDI bean scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`.\n2. We will update the `ShippingService` class by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with `@ApplicationScoped`.\n3. We will also update the imports to reflect the changes in the annotation."]
