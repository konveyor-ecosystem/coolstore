      "content": "## Reasoning\n\nThe issue to be fixed is related to the `@Incoming` annotation on the `onMessage` method. The `@Incoming` annotation is used to specify the name of the queue or topic from which the message is received. However, the issue description suggests that the `destinationLookup` property can be migrated by annotating a message handler method with the `@Incoming` annotation.\n\nUpon reviewing the code, we can see that the `@Incoming` annotation is already present on the `onMessage` method. However, the issue description is likely referring to the fact that the `@Incoming` annotation is not sufficient to replace the `destinationLookup` property in a Java EE MDB (Message-Driven Bean).\n\nIn Quarkus, the `@Incoming` annotation is used in conjunction with the `@Channel` annotation to specify the name of the queue or topic. The `@Channel` annotation is used to inject an `Emitter` instance, which is used to send messages to the specified queue or topic.\n\nTo fix the issue, we need to remove the `@Incoming` annotation from the `onMessage` method and instead use the `@Consume` annotation from the `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging` package. The `@Consume` annotation is used to specify the name of the queue or topic from which the message is received.\n\n## Updated java File\n\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Channel;\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Emitter;\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Consume;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Message;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@ApplicationScoped\npublic class OrderServiceMDB {\n\n    @Inject\n    OrderService orderService;\n\n    @Inject\n    CatalogService catalogService;\n\n    @Inject\n    @Channel(\"topic/orders\")\n    Emitter<String> emitter;\n\n    @Consume(\"topic/orders\")\n    public void onMessage(Message<String> message) {\n        System.out.println(\"\\nMessage recd !\");\n        try {\n            Order order = Transformers.jsonToOrder(message.getPayload());\n            System.out.println(\"Order object is \" + order);\n            orderService.save(order);\n            order.getItemList().forEach(orderItem -> {\n                catalogService.updateInventoryItems(orderItem.getProductId(), orderItem.getQuantity());\n            });\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(e);\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\n\nNote that we also changed the `onMessage` method to take a `Message<String>` parameter instead of a `String` parameter. This is because the `@Consume` annotation requires the method to take a `Message` parameter, which contains the payload of the message.\n\nAdditionally, we updated the `Transformers.jsonToOrder` method call to use `message.getPayload()` instead of just `message`. This is because the `Message` class has a `getPayload()` method that returns the payload of the message, which is the actual message content.\n\nNo changes are required to the `pom.xml` file for this specific issue. However, you may need to add the `smallrye-reactive-messaging` dependency to your `pom.xml` file if it's not already present.",
