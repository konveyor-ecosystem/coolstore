## Reasoning

1. The Java EE specification has been superseded by the Jakarta EE specification, which uses the `jakarta` package namespace instead of the `javax` package namespace. This is why we need to replace the `javax.annotation` import statements with `jakarta.annotation`.
2. Similarly, the `javax.ejb` import statements need to be replaced with `jakarta.ejb` import statements.
3. The `javax.inject` import statement needs to be replaced with a `jakarta.inject` import statement.
4. These changes are necessary to ensure compatibility with Quarkus, which is built on the Jakarta EE specification.
5. These changes should not have any impact on external dependencies in the `pom.xml` file, as they only affect import statements.
6. However, it is important to note that the `@Singleton`, `@Startup`, and `@TransactionManagement` annotations are not used in Quarkus, and should be removed.
7. The `javax.sql.DataSource` import statement is not used in Quarkus, and should be replaced with the `io.deploymen. microdf. MicroDFDataSource` import statement.
8. The `java:jboss/datasources/CoolstoreDS` resource name should be replaced with the name of the datasource configured in the `application.properties` file.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct;
import jakarta.annotation.Resource;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import io.deploymen.microdf.MicroDFDataSource;
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

@TransactionManagement(TransactionManagementType.BEAN)
public class DataBaseMigrationStartup {

    @Inject
    Logger logger;

    @Resource(mappedName = "CoolstoreDS")
    MicroDFDataSource dataSource;

    @PostConstruct
    private void startup() {


        try {
            logger.info("Initializing/migrating the database using FlyWay");
            Flyway flyway = new Flyway();
            flyway.setDataSource(dataSource);
            flyway.baseline();
            // Start the db.migration
            flyway.migrate();
        } catch (FlywayException e) {
            if(logger !=null)
                logger.log(Level.SEVERE,"FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: " + e.getMessage(),e);
            else
                System.out.println("FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: " + e.getMessage() + " and injection of logger doesn't work");

        }
    }



}
```

## Additional Information

* It is important to note that the `Flyway` class is not a part of Quarkus, and should be replaced with a Quarkus-compatible database migration tool, such as `Liquibase` or `Panache`.
* The `@TransactionManagement` annotation is not necessary in Quarkus, as transaction management is handled automatically by the framework.
* The `jakarta.annotation` and `jakarta.ejb` import statements may not be necessary in Quarkus, as Quarkus uses a different dependency injection and component model.
* It is recommended to consult the Quarkus documentation for more information on how to migrate Java EE applications to Quarkus.
