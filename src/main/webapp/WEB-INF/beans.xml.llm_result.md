## Reasoning

1. The first step is to replace the `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` namespace with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` in all three lines (18, 20, 21) as per the issues described. This change is necessary because Java EE has been rebranded to Jakarta EE and the namespace has been updated accordingly.
2. The second step is to replace the schema location `beans_1_1.xsd` with `beans_3_0.xsd` and update the version attribute to `"3.0"` in line 21. This change is necessary because the Quarkus framework supports CDI 3.0, which is the latest version and has several improvements and new features compared to CDI 1.1.
3. The third step is to consider removing the `beans.xml` file altogether. According to the Quarkus documentation, the `beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored and it could be removed from the application. This is because Quarkus enables CDI by default and the `beans.xml` file is not necessary to indicate that CDI should be enabled.

## Updated File

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!-- Marker file indicating CDI should be enabled -->
<beans xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="
      https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee
      https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/beans_3_0.xsd"
    bean-discovery-mode="all">
</beans>
```

## Additional Information

It is important to note that the `beans.xml` file may not be necessary in a Quarkus application, and removing it may simplify the application structure. However, if there are specific configurations or settings in the `beans.xml` file that are required for the application to function correctly, then it should be retained and modified accordingly. It is recommended to consult the Quarkus documentation and verify the supported CDI features before removing the `beans.xml` file.
