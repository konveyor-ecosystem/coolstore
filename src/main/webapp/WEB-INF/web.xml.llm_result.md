## Reasoning

The issue identified is related to session replication, which is not suitable for a cloud environment where container restarts can cause data loss. To address this issue, we need to disable HTTP session clustering.

In Quarkus, we can achieve this by using the `@InvalidateSession` annotation on the application's main class. This annotation disables the HTTP session clustering.

However, since we are dealing with a `web.xml` file, which is not a Java class, we cannot use annotations. Instead, we need to remove the `<distributable />` element from the `web.xml` file, which is responsible for enabling session replication.

## Updated File

```xml
<!--suppress ServletWithoutMappingInspection -->
<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd"
         version="3.0">
</web-app>
```

## Additional Information

Note that removing the `<distributable />` element will disable session replication, and the application will need to be re-architected to use a cache backing service or a remote data grid to store sessions. This will require additional changes to the application code and configuration.

Also, since we are migrating to Quarkus, we may need to update the `pom.xml` file to remove any dependencies related to session replication and add dependencies for the chosen caching or data grid solution. However, this is out of scope for this specific step.
