## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 and 2:** In Quarkus, the package `javax.ws.rs` has been replaced with `jakarta.ws.rs`. This is due to the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE, which involved a change in the package namespace. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ws.rs` import statements with `jakarta.ws.rs` on lines 3 and 4.

2. **Issue 3 and 4:** In Quarkus, JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary, and the root path can be set directly in the `io.quarkus.arc.processor.BeanArchive` annotation. This annotation is used to indicate that a class is a bean archive, which is a container for managed beans. The `@ApplicationPath` annotation is not needed in Quarkus. Therefore, we can remove the `@ApplicationPath` annotation and its value from lines 7 and 8.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;

import io.quarkus.arc.processor.BeanArchive;

@BeanArchive
public class RestApplication extends Application {

}
```

## Additional Information

In the updated file, we have removed the `@ApplicationPath` annotation and its value, and replaced the `javax.ws.rs` import statements with `jakarta.ws.rs`. We have also added the `@BeanArchive` annotation to indicate that this class is a bean archive.

Regarding the `pom.xml` file, we don't need to make any changes, as the input file does not have any external dependencies. However, if there were any external dependencies in the `pom.xml` file, we would need to check if they are compatible with Quarkus and update them if necessary.

Finally, we would need to test the updated file to ensure that it works as expected in the Quarkus environment.
