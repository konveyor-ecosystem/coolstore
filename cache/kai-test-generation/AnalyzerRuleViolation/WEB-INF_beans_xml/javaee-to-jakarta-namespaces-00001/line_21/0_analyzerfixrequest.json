The current namespace is not specified, but the issue suggests that it should be replaced with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee`. Additionally, the schema version number should be updated.\n\nHowever, since the file is currently empty and commented out, we can simply update the namespace and schema version number in the commented-out section. This will ensure that if the file is populated in the future, it will have the correct namespace and schema version number.\n\nNo changes are required to the `pom.xml` file or imports, as this is an XML configuration file and does not affect the project's dependencies or Java code.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<!-- This file can be removed as its content is ignored in Quarkus -->\n<!-- If this file were to be populated, the updated namespace and schema version number should be used:\n<beans xmlns=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee\"\n       xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n       xsi:schemaLocation=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee\n       https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/beans_4_0.xsd\"\n       version=\"4.0\" bean-discovery-mode=\"all\">\n-->\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNote that the schema version number has been updated to `4.0`, which is the latest version for Jakarta EE. If you are targeting a specific version of Jakarta EE, you may need to adjust the schema version number accordingly.",
