## Reasoning

1. The issue mentioned is related to session replication in a Java EE application.
2. Quarkus does not support session replication in the same way as Java EE.
3. To address this issue, we need to remove the `<distributable />` tag from the `web.xml` file as it is used to enable session replication in Java EE applications.
4. By removing the `<distributable />` tag, we are disabling session replication in the Quarkus application.
