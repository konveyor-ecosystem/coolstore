## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1:** The package `javax.enterprise.context` needs to be replaced with `jakarta.enterprise.context`. This is because Java EE APIs have been rebranded to Jakarta EE, and the package names have changed accordingly. Quarkus is built on top of Jakarta EE, so we need to use the Jakarta EE package names.

2. **Issue 2:** The package `javax.inject` needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject`. This is similar to Issue 1, where the package names have changed due to the rebranding from Java EE to Jakarta EE.

3. **Issue 3:** The package `javax.ws.rs` needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ws.rs`. This is similar to Issues 1 and 2, where the package names have changed due to the rebranding from Java EE to Jakarta EE.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.List;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.*;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Product;
import com.redhat.coolstore.service.ProductService;

@RequestScoped
@Path("/products")
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class ProductEndpoint implements Serializable {

    /**
     *
     */
    private static final long serialVersionUID = -7227732980791688773L;

    @Inject
    private ProductService pm;


    @GET
    @Path("/")
    public List<Product> listAll() {
        return pm.getProducts();
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/{itemId}")
    public Product getProduct(@PathParam("itemId") String itemId) {
        return pm.getProductByItemId(itemId);
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

No additional steps are required for this migration. However, it is important to note that this is just the first step in migrating to Quarkus. There may be additional changes required for a full migration, such as updating the `pom.xml` file and adjusting any external dependencies. Additionally, Quarkus has its own set of APIs and frameworks, so it may be necessary to update the code to use Quarkus-specific APIs and frameworks in future steps.
