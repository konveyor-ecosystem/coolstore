["1. **Issue 1:** The `javax.ejb` package is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package in Jakarta EE, which is `jakarta.ejb`. This change is necessary because Quarkus is based on Jakarta EE, and the package names have been updated to reflect this.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** The `javax.inject` package is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package in Jakarta EE, which is `jakarta.inject`. This change is necessary because Quarkus is based on Jakarta EE, and the package names have been updated to reflect this.\n\n3. **Issue 3:** The `javax.persistence` package is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package in Jakarta EE, which is `jakarta.persistence`. This change is necessary because Quarkus is based on Jakarta EE, and the package names have been updated to reflect this.\n\n4. **Issue 4:** The `javax.persistence` package is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package in Jakarta EE, which is `jakarta.persistence`. This change is necessary because Quarkus is based on Jakarta EE, and the package names have been updated to reflect this.\n\n5. **Issue 5:** The `javax.persistence` package is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package in Jakarta EE, which is `jakarta.persistence`. This change is necessary because Quarkus is based on Jakarta EE, and the package names have been updated to reflect this.\n\n6. **Issue 6:** The `javax.persistence` package is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent package in Jakarta EE, which is `jakarta.persistence`. This change is necessary because Quarkus is based on Jakarta EE, and the package names have been updated to reflect this.\n\n7. **Issue 7:** In Quarkus, the `EntityManager` is automatically created and injected when the datasource is correctly configured. Therefore, the `@Produces` annotation is not needed and should be removed. The `@Stateless` annotation should be replaced with a scope annotation, such as `@ApplicationScoped`.\n\n8. **Issue 8:** The `@Stateless` annotation is not needed in Quarkus, as it is based on CDI and does not use EJBs. The annotation should be replaced with a scope annotation, such as `@ApplicationScoped`."]
