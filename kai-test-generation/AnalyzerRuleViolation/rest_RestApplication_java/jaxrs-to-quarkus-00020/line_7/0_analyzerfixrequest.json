This is because Quarkus automatically enables JAX-RS if it detects the necessary dependencies in the project.\n\nHowever, the `@ApplicationPath` annotation is still used to specify the root path for the REST services. In Quarkus, this can be achieved using the `quarkus.http.root-path` property in the `application.properties` file or using the `@Path` annotation on the application class.\n\nGiven the information, we can remove the `@ApplicationPath` annotation and the `extends Application` clause, as they are not necessary in Quarkus.\n\nWe will also remove the import statement for `jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application` as it is no longer needed.\n\nHowever, we will keep the `@ApplicationPath` annotation import statement, as we might need it in the future if we decide to use it in a different context.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.rest;\n\nimport jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;\n\n/**\n * REST Application\n */\n@ApplicationPath(\"/services\")\npublic class RestApplication {\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific issue. However, it's worth noting that the Quarkus JAX-RS extension should be included in the project dependencies for JAX-RS to work properly. This can be done by adding the following dependency to the `pom.xml` file:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-resteasy</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\nIf this dependency is not already present, it should be added to enable JAX-RS support in the Quarkus project.",
