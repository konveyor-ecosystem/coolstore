["The migration of the given Java EE file to Quarkus primarily involves three changes.\n\n1. Replace `javax.inject` with `jakarta.inject`: As per the issue found from static analysis, we need to replace `javax.inject` with `jakarta.inject`. This is because Jakarta EE is the new namespace for standard Java EE APIs.\n\n2. Replace `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener` with `javax.annotation.PostConstruct` and `javax.annotation.PreDestroy`: The `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener` is specific to the WebLogic application server and hence, cannot be used in Quarkus. Instead, we can use the `javax.annotation.PostConstruct` and `javax.annotation.PreDestroy` annotations, which are standard Java EE annotations for defining methods that should be executed post construction and pre destruction of a bean.\n\n3. Remove `extends ApplicationLifecycleListener`: In Quarkus, there is no need to extend any specific class to have startup or shutdown events. The methods annotated with `@PostConstruct` and `@PreDestroy` will be called at the respective lifecycle events.\n\nNote that, there is no need to change the imports in `pom.xml` file as `jakarta.inject` and `javax.annotation` are included in the `jakarta.jakartaee-api` dependency, which is included by default in Quarkus."]
