## Reasoning

1. The first step is to replace the `javax.annotation` import statement with `jakarta.annotation`. This is because Jakarta EE is the new namespace for Java EE in Jakarta EE 9 and onwards. 

2. The second step is to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`. This is because Jakarta EE is the new namespace for Java EE in Jakarta EE 9 and onwards. 

3. The third step is to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is because Jakarta EE is the new namespace for Java EE in Jakarta EE 9 and onwards. 

4. The fourth and fifth steps are to replace the `javax.jms` import statements with `jakarta.jms`. This is because Jakarta EE is the new namespace for Java EE in Jakarta EE 9 and onwards. 

5. The sixth and seventh steps are to replace the JMS `Topic`s with Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel. This is because Quarkus uses the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification for messaging, which uses `Emitter`s and `Channel`s instead of JMS `Topic`s.

6. The eighth and ninth steps are to remove references to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements and replace them with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This is because Quarkus uses the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification for messaging, which has different classes and interfaces than JMS.

7. The tenth step is to convert the Stateless EJB to a CDI bean by importing `jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped` and replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with `@ApplicationScoped`. This is because Quarkus does not support EJBs, but it does support CDI beans.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import java.util.logging.Logger;
import jakarta.ejb.Stateless;
import jakarta.annotation.Resource;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Channel;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Emitter;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;
import com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;

@ApplicationScoped
public class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    @Inject
    @Channel("orders")
    Emitter<String> ordersEmitter;

    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {
        log.info("Sending order from processor: ");
        ordersEmitter.send(Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));
    }
}
```

## Additional Information

The `jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped` import statement needs to be added to the import statements at the top of the file. The `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Channel` and `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Emitter` import statements also need to be added to the import statements at the top of the file. The `jakarta.jms.JMSContext` and `jakarta.jms.Topic` import statements need to be removed from the import statements at the top of the file.
