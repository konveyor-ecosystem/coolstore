## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11:** Java EE namespaces have been changed to Jakarta EE in Java 11, and Quarkus is built for Java 11. Therefore, we need to change the import statements to use the Jakarta EE namespaces.

2. **Issue 3:** The `javax.inject` package is not used in Quarkus. Instead, Quarkus uses the `jakarta.inject` package.

3. **Issue 5:** Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) are not supported in Quarkus. CDI must be used. Therefore, we need to replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.

4. **Issue 12, 13, 14, 15:** References to Java EE/Jakarta EE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents.

5. **Issue 16:** The `destinationLookup` property can be migrated by annotating a message handler method (potentially `onMessage`) with the `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming` annotation, indicating the name of the queue as a value.

    @Inject

    @Incoming("topic/orders")
    public void onMessage(TextMessage rcvMessage) {
        System.out.println("\nMessage recd !");
        TextMessage msg = null;
        try {
            if (rcvMessage instanceof TextMessage) {
                msg = (TextMessage) rcvMessage;
                String orderStr = msg.getBody(String.class);
                System.out.println("Received order: " + orderStr);
                Order order = Transformers.jsonToOrder(orderStr);
                System.out.println("Order object is " + order);
                orderService.save(order);
                order.getItemList().forEach(orderItem -> {
                    catalogService.updateInventoryItems(orderItem.getProductId(), orderItem.getQuantity());
                });
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}
