["In the process of migrating from Java EE to Quarkus, we have two main issues identified by static analysis to deal with. \n\nThe first one is about the `javax.ejb` library. In Quarkus, there's no direct support for the `@Stateful` annotation from `javax.ejb`, because Quarkus is built on top of the Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) specification. The lifecycle of a bean in Quarkus is managed by the CDI container. Therefore, we'll have to replace the `@Stateful` annotation with a CDI scope annotation. In this case, I'll use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation. \n\nThe second issue is about the `javax.inject` library. Quarkus supports the `javax.inject` package, so we don't need to replace it with `jakarta.inject`. \n\nThe other change we need to make is related to the JNDI lookup. In Quarkus, there's no support for JNDI as it's a blocking API and Quarkus promotes a non-blocking development model. The services that were previously looked up via JNDI should be injected directly. \n\nLet's start with the migration.\n\nFirst, replace `import javax.ejb.Stateful;` with `import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;`.\nThen, remove the JNDI lookup for `ShippingServiceRemote` and instead, inject it directly. \n\nFinally, ensure that all the components that are being injected (`ProductService, PromoService, ShoppingCartOrderProcessor, ShippingServiceRemote`) are also properly migrated to Quarkus, meaning they should be CDI beans."]
