["1. We need to replace the `javax.annotation` import statement with `jakarta.annotation`. This is because Jakarta EE is the successor of Java EE and the packages have been renamed accordingly.\n\n2. We need to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`. Again, this is because Jakarta EE is the successor of Java EE and the packages have been renamed accordingly.\n\n3. We need to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is for the same reason as the above points.\n\n4. We need to replace the `javax.jms` import statements with `jakarta.jms`. This is for the same reason as the above points.\n\n5. In Quarkus, JMS `Topic`s should be replaced with Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel. This is because Quarkus utilizes the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging API for messaging and thus we need to migrate to this API.\n\n6. References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This is because Quarkus uses different APIs and libraries for messaging.\n\n7. Stateless EJBs can be converted to a cdi bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope eg `@ApplicationScoped`. This is because Quarkus does not support EJBs as they are part of the Java EE spec, not the Jakarta EE spec.\n\nNote: As we are changing the messaging system, the dependencies in the pom.xml should also be updated to include SmallRye Reactive Messaging."]
