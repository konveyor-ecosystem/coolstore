## Reasoning

1. The first issue is about updating the XML namespace from `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` to `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee`. This change is necessary because the Java EE specification has been migrated to Jakarta EE, and the new namespace reflects this change. This impacts the `beans.xml` file on lines 18, 20, and 21.

2. The second issue is about updating the schema location and version number. The schema location needs to be updated to point to the Jakarta EE schema location, and the version number needs to be updated to reflect the latest version of CDI. This impacts line 21 of the `beans.xml` file.

3. The third issue is about removing the `beans.xml` file entirely. In Quarkus, CDI is enabled by default, and the `beans.xml` file is not required. Therefore, it can be safely removed.

## Updated File

```xml
<!-- Empty file, as CDI is enabled by default in Quarkus -->
```

## Additional Information

When removing the `beans.xml` file, it is important to ensure that any dependencies related to Java EE or CDI are removed from the `pom.xml` file. Additionally, any imports related to Java EE or CDI should be removed from the Java code. If there are any annotations related to Java EE or CDI, the imports for those annotations should be added to the Java code. It is also important to ensure that any configuration related to Java EE or CDI is removed from the `application.properties` file.
