 ## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 & 2:** The Java EE APIs have been rebranded to Jakarta EE, and the package names have changed from `javax` to `jakarta`. This change is required to ensure compatibility with Quarkus, which is built on Jakarta EE.

2. **Issue 3:** In Quarkus, the `@Produces` annotation is not required if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. Instead, we can use the `@Named` annotation to access the field. This simplifies the code and reduces the need for explicit annotations.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;
import jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Producers {

    Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());

    @Produces
    @Named
    public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

No additional information is required for this migration step. However, it is important to note that further changes may be required to fully migrate this code to Quarkus, such as updating any dependencies or integrations with other Java EE components. These changes will be addressed in subsequent steps.
