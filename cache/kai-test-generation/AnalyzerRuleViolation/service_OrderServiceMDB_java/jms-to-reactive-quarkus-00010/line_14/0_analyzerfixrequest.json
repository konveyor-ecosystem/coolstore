      "content": "## Reasoning\nThe issue at hand is that the `@MessageDriven` annotation is not supported in Quarkus. This annotation is typically used in Java EE to define a message-driven bean. However, in Quarkus, we need to use CDI (Context and Dependency Injection) instead.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with a CDI scope annotation. However, since the `@MessageDriven` annotation is not present in the provided code, we can't directly replace it. \n\nInstead, we can add a CDI scope annotation to the class to make it a CDI bean. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is a good choice here, as it makes the bean available for the entire application.\n\nAdditionally, we need to consider the impact on external dependencies in the `pom.xml` file. Since we are using Quarkus, we need to make sure that the Quarkus CDI extension is included in the `pom.xml` file. This extension is usually included by default when creating a new Quarkus project.\n\nWe also need to consider the imports. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is part of the `jakarta.enterprise.context` package, so we need to make sure that this package is imported.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Channel;\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Emitter;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@ApplicationScoped\npublic class OrderServiceMDB {\n\n    @Inject\n    OrderService orderService;\n\n    @Inject\n    CatalogService catalogService;\n\n    @Inject\n    @Channel(\"topic/orders\")\n    Emitter<String> emitter;\n\n    @Channel(\"topic/orders\")\n    public void onMessage(String message) {\n        System.out.println(\"\\nMessage recd !\");\n        try {\n            Order order = Transformers.jsonToOrder(message);\n            System.out.println(\"Order object is \" + order);\n            orderService.save(order);\n            order.getItemList().forEach(orderItem -> {\n                catalogService.updateInventoryItems(orderItem.getProductId(), orderItem.getQuantity());\n            });\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(e);\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nMake sure that the Quarkus CDI extension is included in the `pom.xml` file. This can be done by adding the following dependency:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-arc</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\nAlso, make sure that the `jakarta.enterprise.context` package is imported in the Java file.",
