["1. The first step is to address the issues found from the static analysis. These issues are related to the usage of the `javax.persistence` package, which is the Java EE persistence API. In Quarkus, we use the Jakarta EE persistence API, which is under the `jakarta.persistence` package. Therefore, we need to replace all the `javax.persistence` import statements with `jakarta.persistence`.\n\n2. After addressing the issues, we need to check if there are any other dependencies that need to be updated or added to the `pom.xml` file. In this case, the `Order` class does not have any external dependencies, so we don't need to update the `pom.xml` file.\n\n3. We also need to check if there are any changes required in the code due to the migration from Java EE to Quarkus. In this case, the `Order` class is a simple Java bean that represents an order in the system. There are no Quarkus-specific annotations or features used in this class. Therefore, we don't need to make any changes to the code."]
