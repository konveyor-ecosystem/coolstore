## Reasoning

I will start by removing the `javax.annotation` and `javax.ejb` imports and replace them with `jakarta.annotation` and `jakarta.ejb` respectively.

Next, I will update the `DataSource` reference to `java:jboss/datasources/CoolstoreDS` to `java:jboss/datasources/reactive-customer-data-source`.

I will also update the `Flyway` usage to use the `DataSource` reference I just updated.

## Updated File
```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import org.flywaydb.core.Flyway;
import org.flywaydb.core.api.FlywayException;

import jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct;
import jakarta.ejb.Singleton;
import jakarta.ejb.Startup;
import jakarta.ejb.TransactionManagement;
import jakarta.ejb.TransactionManagementType;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import javax.sql.DataSource;
import java.util.logging.Level;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

/**

@Singleton
@Startup
@TransactionManagement(TransactionManagementType.BEAN)
public class DataBaseMigrationStartup {

    @Inject
    Logger logger;

    @Resource(mappedName = "java:jboss/datasources/reactive-customer-data-source")
    DataSource dataSource;

    @PostConstruct
    private void startup() {


        try {
            logger.info("Initializing/migrating the database using FlyWay");
            Flyway flyway = new Flyway();
            flyway.setDataSource(dataSource);
            flyway.baseline();
            // Start the db.migration
            flyway.migrate();
        } catch (FlywayException e) {
            if(logger !=null)
                logger.log(Level.SEVERE,"FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: " + e.getMessage(),e);
            else
                System.out.println("FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: " + e.getMessage() + " and injection of logger doesn't work");

        }
    }



}
```
