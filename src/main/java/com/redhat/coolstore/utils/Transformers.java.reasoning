["The issues detected by the static source code analysis are related to the import statements for JSON processing. In JavaEE, JSON processing was handled by the `javax.json` package. However, with the migration to JakartaEE and consequently to Quarkus, the package has been renamed to `jakarta.json`.\n\nWe need to replace the `javax.json` imports with `jakarta.json` imports. This change is necessary because Quarkus and other JakartaEE compliant systems use the new `jakarta.json` package for JSON processing.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this change does not affect the behavior of the code as the classes and methods in `javax.json` package are functionally equivalent to those in the `jakarta.json` package. This is purely a change in the package name due to the migration of JavaEE to JakartaEE.\n\nThere's no need to update the `pom.xml` for this change as Quarkus already includes the necessary JakartaEE APIs, including the `jakarta.json` API."]
