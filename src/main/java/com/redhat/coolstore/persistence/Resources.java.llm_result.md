## Issues

### Issue 1
Issue to fix: "Replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise` "
Line number: 3
### Issue 2
Issue to fix: "Replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise` "
Line number: 4
### Issue 3
Issue to fix: "Replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence` "
Line number: 5
### Issue 4
Issue to fix: "Replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence` "
Line number: 6
### Issue 5
Issue to fix: "In JavaEE/JakartaEE, using `@PersistenceContext` was needed in order to inject a data source. Quarkus, on the other hand,
 will create the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource. This makes having a `@Produces` annotation
 on the `EntityManager` illegal in Quarkus.
 
 If you are using a `@Produces` annotation for your EntityManager, and it is not needed after configuring your datasource, remove it and `@Inject` the EntityManager.
 Otherwise, if the producer is still needed, please create a qualification for your produced `EntityManager`, as well as every injection point for the EM.
 
 For instance, you can create an `ExtendedContext` qualifier:
 ```
 @Qualifier
 @Target()
 @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
 public @interface ExtendedContext 
 ```
 and then inject your entity managers:
 ```
 @ExtendedContext
 public EntityManager getEm() 
 ```"
Line number: 5
### Issue 6
Issue to fix: "In Quarkus, you can skip the @Produces annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier..
 This field could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead.
