I will give you a JavaEE file for which I want to take one step towards migrating to Quarkus.

I will provide you with static source code analysis information highlighting an issue which needs to be addressed.

I will also provide you with an example of how a similar issue was solved in the past via a solved example.

You can refer to the solved example for a pattern of how to update the input Java EE file to Quarkus.

Fix only the problem described. Other problems will be solved in subsequent steps so it is unnecessary to handle them now.

Before attempting to migrate the code to Quarkus reason through what changes are required and why.

Pay attention to changes you make and impacts to external dependencies in the pom.xml as well as changes to imports we need to consider.

Remember when updating or adding annotations that the class must be imported.

As you make changes that impact the pom.xml or imports, be sure you explain what needs to be updated.

After you have shared your step by step thinking, provide a full output of the updated file.
