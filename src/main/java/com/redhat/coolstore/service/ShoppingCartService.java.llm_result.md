## Reasoning

### Issue 1:
The `javax.ejb` package is part of the Java EE API and is used for Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs). Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which uses the `jakarta` package namespace instead of `javax`. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`.

### Issue 2:
Similarly, the `javax.inject` package is part of the Java EE API and is used for dependency injection. In Quarkus, we need to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`.

### Other Changes:
We don't need to make any changes to the `import` statements for the `com.redhat.coolstore.model` package since it is part of the application's model and is not affected by the migration to Quarkus.

We also don't need to make any changes to the `import` statements for the `java.util` and `java.util.logging` packages since they are part of the Java SE API and are not affected by the migration to Quarkus.

However, we need to be aware that the `@Stateful` annotation is not supported in Quarkus. Instead, we can use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to indicate that the bean is application-scoped.

Additionally, we need to replace the `@Inject` annotation with `@Injected` for the `ProductService` and `PromoService` fields.

Finally, we need to remove the `lookupShippingServiceRemote()` method since it is used to look up a remote EJB, which is not supported in Quarkus. Instead, we can use the `@Inject` annotation to inject the `ShippingServiceRemote` bean directly.

## Additional Information

We also need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the Quarkus dependencies for the `ProductService`, `PromoService`, and `ShippingServiceRemote` beans. We can use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to indicate that these beans are application-scoped.

Additionally, we need to remove the `lookupShippingServiceRemote()` method from the `ShoppingCartService` class and inject the `ShippingServiceRemote` bean directly using the `@Inject` annotation. We also need to remove the `jndiProperties` and `InitialContext` classes since they are used to look up remote EJBs, which is not supported in Quarkus.

Finally, we need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the Quarkus dependencies for the
