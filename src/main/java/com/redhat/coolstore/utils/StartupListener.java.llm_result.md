## Reasoning

1. The first step is to understand the issue. The issue is to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is because Quarkus uses the `jakarta` namespace instead of the `javax` namespace.

2. The `javax.inject` namespace is part of the Java EE specification, while `jakarta.inject` is part of the Jakarta EE specification. Quarkus is built on top of the Jakarta EE specification, hence the need for the change.

3. The `@Inject` annotation is used for dependency injection. In this case, it is used to inject a `Logger` instance. This annotation is part of the `javax.inject` package in the Java EE specification, but it is also present in the `jakarta.inject` package in the Jakarta EE specification.

4. Therefore, we can replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject` without affecting the functionality of the code.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent;
import jakarta.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener;
import jakarta.util.logging.Logger;

public class StartupListener extends ApplicationLifecycleListener {

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    @Override
    public void postStart(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {
        log.info("AppListener(postStart)");
    }

    @Override
    public void preStop(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {
        log.info("AppListener(preStop)");
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

- The `pom.xml` file does not need to be updated as part of this step, as there are no changes to the dependencies.
- The imports have been updated to reflect the use of the Jakarta EE specification instead of the Java EE specification.
- The `@Inject` annotation has been left as is, as it is present in both the `javax.inject` and `jakarta.inject` packages.
