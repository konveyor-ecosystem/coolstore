However, the provided file \"beans.xml\" is empty and does not contain any namespace or schema version number.\n\nGiven the empty file, we can assume that the namespace and schema version number are not present in this file. However, we can still provide the updated namespace and schema version number that should be used in the \"beans.xml\" file if it were to be populated.\n\nThe updated namespace `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` is the new namespace for Jakarta EE, replacing the old `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` namespace. The schema version number should also be updated to match the version of Jakarta EE being used.\n\nSince the file is empty, we will not make any changes to it. However, we will provide the updated namespace and schema version number that should be used if the file were to be populated.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<!-- This file can be removed as its content is ignored in Quarkus -->\n<!-- If this file were to be populated, the updated namespace and schema version number should be used:\n<beans xmlns=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee\"\n       xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n       xsi:schemaLocation=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee\n       https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/beans_4_0.xsd\"\n       version=\"4.0\" bean-discovery-mode=\"all\">\n-->\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNote that the \"beans.xml\" file is not required in Jakarta EE 9 and later versions. The file is only required if you need to use the `bean-discovery-mode=\"annotated\"` or `bean-discovery-mode=\"none\"` attributes. If you are using Jakarta EE 9 or later, you can remove this file altogether.\n\nAlso, note that the `beans_4_0.xsd` schema version number may vary depending on the version of Jakarta EE being used. Make sure to use the correct schema version number for your version of Jakarta EE.",
