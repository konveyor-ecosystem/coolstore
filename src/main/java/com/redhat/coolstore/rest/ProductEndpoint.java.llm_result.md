## Reasoning

1. The first issue to address is the import statement for `javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped` which needs to be updated to `jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped`. This is because the Java EE packages have been replaced by Jakarta EE packages in Quarkus, and the `@RequestScoped` annotation is used to indicate that the instance of the class should be created once per request.

2. The second issue is the import statement for `javax.inject.Inject` which needs to be updated to `jakarta.inject.Inject`. This is because the `@Inject` annotation is used to inject dependencies into the class, and similar to the first issue, the Java EE packages have been replaced by Jakarta EE packages in Quarkus.

3. The third issue is the import statement for `javax.ws.rs` which needs to be updated to `jakarta.ws.rs`. This is because the `@Path`, `@Consumes`, `@Produces`, `@GET`, `@PathParam`, and `MediaType` annotations are used to define the REST endpoint and its behavior, and similar to the first and second issues, the Java EE packages have been replaced by Jakarta EE packages in Quarkus.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import java.io.Serializable;
import java.util.List;

import jakarta.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.ws.rs.*;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Product;
import com.redhat.coolstore.service.ProductService;

@RequestScoped
@Path("/products")
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class ProductEndpoint implements Serializable {

    /**
     *
     */
    private static final long serialVersionUID = -7227732980791688773L;

    @Inject
    private ProductService pm;


    @GET
    @Path("/")
    public List<Product> listAll() {
        return pm.getProducts();
    }

    @GET
    @Path("/{itemId}")
    public Product getProduct(@PathParam("itemId") String itemId) {
        return pm.getProductByItemId(itemId);
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

It is important to note that the changes made in this step only address the issues described and do not cover all the necessary changes required to fully migrate the Java EE code to Quarkus. Additional steps will be required to complete the migration, such as updating the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary Quarkus dependencies and removing any unused imports.
