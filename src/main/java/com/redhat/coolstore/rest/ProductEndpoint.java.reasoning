["1. **Issue 1:** The Java EE namespace for CDI has been changed to `jakarta.enterprise` in Quarkus. This is a breaking change and needs to be addressed. The `@RequestScoped` annotation is used to create a new instance of the bean for each HTTP request. This annotation is part of the Context and Dependency Injection (CDI) specification.\n\n2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, the Java EE namespace for injection has been changed to `jakarta.inject` in Quarkus. This is also a breaking change and needs to be addressed. The `@Inject` annotation is used to inject dependencies into a class.\n\n3. **Issue 3:** The Java EE namespace for JAX-RS has been changed to `jakarta.ws` in Quarkus. This is a breaking change and needs to be addressed. The `@Path`, `@Consumes`, and `@Produces` annotations are used to define the endpoint, the media types that the endpoint can consume, and the media types that the endpoint can produce, respectively.\n\n4. The `ProductService` is injected but not used in the `getProduct` method. This is not an error but it is a potential issue if the `ProductService` is not needed in this method.\n\n5. The `serialVersionUID` is not needed in Quarkus and can be removed.\n\n6. The `List<Product>` in the `listAll` method should be changed to `Uni<List<Product>>` to use the reactive style of Quarkus.\n\n7. The `Product` in the `getProduct` method should be changed to `Uni<Product>` to use the reactive style of Quarkus.\n\n8. The `ProductService` should be a `@Dependent` bean instead of a `@RequestScoped` bean because it is injected into a `@RequestScoped` bean."]
