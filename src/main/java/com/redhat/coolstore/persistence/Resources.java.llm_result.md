## Reasoning

1. The `javax.enterprise` import statement needs to be replaced with `jakarta.enterprise` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus.
2. The `javax.persistence` import statement needs to be replaced with `jakarta.persistence` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus.
3. The `@Produces` annotation on the `EntityManager` method needs to be removed in Quarkus as it is not needed when configuring the datasource correctly. Instead, we should `@Inject` the `EntityManager` where needed.
4. Since the `@Produces` annotation is being removed, we need to create a qualifier for the produced `EntityManager` and every injection point for the `EntityManager`. In this case, we will create an `ExtendedContext` qualifier.
5. The `@Produces` annotation on the `getEntityManager` method should be replaced with a `@Named` annotation on the method to allow access to the field.

@Dependent
public class Resources {

    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager em;

        return em;
    }
