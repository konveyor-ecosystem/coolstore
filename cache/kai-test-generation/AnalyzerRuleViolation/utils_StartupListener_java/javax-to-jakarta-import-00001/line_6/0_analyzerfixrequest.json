      "content": "## Reasoning\nTo address the issue described, we need to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is because the `javax.inject` package is part of the Java EE specification, and when migrating to Jakarta EE, the package names are changed from `javax` to `jakarta`.\n\nHere are the steps to fix the issue:\n\n1. Identify the import statement that needs to be replaced: `import javax.inject.Inject;`\n2. Replace the import statement with the new package name: `import jakarta.inject.Inject;`\n3. Verify that the `@Inject` annotation is still valid and functional after the package change.\n\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific issue, as we are only updating an import statement. However, when migrating to Jakarta EE, additional dependencies and configuration changes may be required in the `pom.xml` file.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent;\nimport weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener;\n\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\npublic class StartupListener extends ApplicationLifecycleListener {\n\n    @Inject\n    Logger log;\n\n    @Override\n    public void postStart(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(postStart)\");\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void preStop(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {\n        log.info(\"AppListener(preStop)\");\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNote that the `weblogic.application` package is specific to WebLogic Server and may not be compatible with Jakarta EE. When migrating to Jakarta EE, you may need to replace this package with a Jakarta EE equivalent, such as `jakarta.enterprise.event` or `jakarta.servlet`. However, this is outside the scope of the current issue.",
