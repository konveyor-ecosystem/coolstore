["As per the issues found, the main concern is the migration from `javax` to `jakarta` namespaces, as part of the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE. However, Quarkus does not directly support the full Jakarta EE APIs yet, and it has a different approach to dependency injection and transaction management.\n\nHere are the steps to migrate the given Java EE code to Quarkus:\n\n1. Replace all the `javax` imports with their `jakarta` equivalents. However, some classes might not have direct `jakarta` equivalents or might not be supported by Quarkus yet. In those cases, we need to find a Quarkus-specific alternative or explain why we are unable to do so.\n\n2. The annotations `@Singleton`, `@Startup`, `@TransactionManagement` and `@Resource` are not directly supported in Quarkus. Quarkus uses CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) for managing beans and transactions. So, we need to replace `@Singleton` and `@Startup` with `@ApplicationScoped` and `@StartupEvent`, respectively. \n\n3. The `@TransactionManagement` annotation is not needed in Quarkus, since it automatically manages transactions. \n\n4. The `@Resource` annotation is not directly supported in Quarkus. Instead, we can inject the `DataSource` using `@Inject` and `@Named` annotations.\n\n5. The `Logger` can still be injected using the `@Inject` annotation. However, we might need to configure the logger in Quarkus application properties.\n\n6. The `Flyway` configuration and usage can remain the same, as Quarkus supports Flyway for database migrations. However, we might need to add the Flyway dependency in the `pom.xml` file.\n\n7. We need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary Quarkus dependencies like `quarkus-arc` for CDI, `quarkus-agroal` for `DataSource`, `quarkus-narayana-jta` for transactions, and `quarkus-flyway` for Flyway support."]
