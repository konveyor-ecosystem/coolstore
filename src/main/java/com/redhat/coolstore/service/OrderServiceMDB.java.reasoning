["In migrating the JavaEE code to Quarkus, various steps will be followed. \n\nFirstly, Quarkus does not support Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) as indicated in Issue 8, and as such, we need to replace the `javax.ejb` import statements with `jakarta.ejb` as indicated in Issue 1 and 2. However, since Quarkus does not support EJBs, we will not be using `jakarta.ejb`. Instead, we will use CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) for our business services. The `@MessageDriven` annotation will be replaced by the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation, which is a CDI scope annotation.\n\nSecondly, we will replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject` as indicated in Issue 3. The `Inject` annotation is used to inject resources into a class.\n\nThirdly, the `javax.jms` import statements need to be replaced with `jakarta.jms` as indicated in issues 4, 5, 6 and 7. However, Quarkus prefers the use of MicroProfile over JakartaEE. Hence, we will not use `jakarta.jms` but instead, we will use SmallRye Reactive Messaging which is an implementation of MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification.\n\nFourthly, the `@MessageDriven` annotation was replaced with the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation in the previous step. However, we still need to handle the `destinationLookup` property which can be migrated by annotating the message handler method (`onMessage`) with the `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming` annotation, indicating the name of the queue as the value. This would be done as indicated in issues 9, 10 and 11.\n\nFinally, all references to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements will be replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents as indicated in issues 12, 13, 14 and 15.\n\nIn addition to these changes, we would also need to update our `pom.xml` file to include the dependency for MicroProfile Reactive Messaging."]
