However, upon reviewing the provided code, we notice that there is no `javax.jms` import statement. The `@Incoming` annotation is from the `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.jms` package, which might be using `jakarta.jms` internally.\n\nSince there's no direct `javax.jms` import, we can't simply replace it. However, we can verify if the `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.jms` package is compatible with Jakarta EE 9+ and JMS 3.0 (which uses `jakarta.jms`).\n\nAssuming the `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.jms` package is compatible, no changes are required in the import statements. However, we should ensure that the `pom.xml` file has the correct dependencies for Jakarta EE 9+ and JMS 3.0.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.jms.Incoming;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\n@Incoming(\"topic/orders\")\npublic class OrderServiceMDB {\n\n    @Inject\n    OrderService orderService;\n\n    @Inject\n    CatalogService catalogService;\n\n    public void onMessage(String message) {\n        System.out.println(\"\\nMessage recd !\");\n        try {\n            Order order = Transformers.jsonToOrder(message);\n            System.out.println(\"Order object is \" + order);\n            orderService.save(order);\n            order.getItemList().forEach(orderItem -> {\n                catalogService.updateInventoryItems(orderItem.getProductId(), orderItem.getQuantity());\n            });\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(e);\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nTo complete the migration, ensure that the `pom.xml` file has the correct dependencies for Jakarta EE 9+ and JMS 3.0. You might need to update the dependencies to use `jakarta.jms` instead of `javax.jms`. Additionally, verify that the `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.jms` package is compatible with Jakarta EE 9+ and JMS 3.0.\n\nExample of updated dependencies in `pom.xml`:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.jms</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.jms-api</artifactId>\n    <version>3.0.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\nNote: The actual version of the `jakarta.jms-api` dependency might vary depending on your project's requirements.",
