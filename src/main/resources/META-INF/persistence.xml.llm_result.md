## Reasoning

1. The first issue to address is to update the XML schema version and namespace for the persistence unit. This is because the current version and namespace are for Java EE, and we need to update them to Jakarta EE to ensure compatibility with Quarkus. This change is required in lines 3, 5, and 6 of the input file.

2. The second issue is to update the version attribute of the root tag from `2.1` to `3.0`. This is to ensure that the persistence unit is using the correct version of the Jakarta EE persistence specification. This change is required in line 2 of the input file.

3. The third issue is to rename properties prefixed by `javax` with `jakarta`. This is because the `javax` namespace is used in Java EE, and we need to update it to `jakarta` to ensure compatibility with Quarkus. This change is required in line 10 of the input file.

4. The fourth issue is to move persistence-related configuration from an XML file to a properties file. This is because Quarkus uses a properties-based configuration system, and it is recommended to centralize the configuration in a properties file. This change is not required in the input file, but it is recommended for future steps in the migration process.

## Updated File

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<persistence version="3.0"
             xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence"
             xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:schemaLocation="
        https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence
        https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_0.xsd">
    <persistence-unit name="primary">
        <jta-data-source>java:jboss/datasources/CoolstoreDS</jta-data-source>
        <properties>
            <property name="jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action" value="none"/>
            <property name="hibernate.show_sql" value="false" />
            <property name="hibernate.format_sql" value="true" />
            <property name="hibernate.use_sql_comments" value="true" />
            <property name="hibernate.jdbc.use_get_generated_keys" value="false" />
        </properties>
    </persistence-unit>
</persistence>
```

## Additional Information

It is recommended to move the persistence-related configuration to a properties file as mentioned in issue 4. Here is an example of how the configuration can be moved to a properties file:

Create a new file named `application.properties` in the `src/main/resources` directory and add the following configuration:

```
quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=<jdbc-url>
quarkus.datasource.username=<username>
quarkus.datasource.password=<password>
quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation=none
quarkus.hibernate-orm.log.format-sql=true
quarkus.hibernate-orm.log.use-sql-comments=true
quarkus.hibernate-orm.log.use-get-generated-keys=false
```

Replace `<jdbc-url>`, `<username>`, and `<password>` with the actual values for your database.

After moving the configuration to a properties file, you can remove the `<properties>` tag from the `persistence.xml` file.
