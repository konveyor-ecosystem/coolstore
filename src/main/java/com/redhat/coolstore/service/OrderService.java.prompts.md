I will give you a JavaEE file for which I want to take one step towards migrating to Quarkus.

I will provide you with static source code analysis information highlighting an issue which needs to be addressed.

I will also provide you with an example of how a similar issue was solved in the past via a solved example.

You can refer to the solved example for a pattern of how to update the input Java EE file to Quarkus.

Fix only the problem described. Other problems will be solved in subsequent steps so it is unnecessary to handle them now.

Before attempting to migrate the code to Quarkus reason through what changes are required and why.

Pay attention to changes you make and impacts to external dependencies in the pom.xml as well as changes to imports we need to consider.

As you make changes that impact the pom.xml or imports, be sure you explain what needs to be updated.

After you have shared your step by step thinking, provide a full output of the updated file.
# Input Information

## Input File

File name: "src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/OrderService.java"
Source file contents:
```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;
import java.util.List;
import javax.ejb.Stateless;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.persistence.EntityManager;
import javax.persistence.criteria.CriteriaBuilder;
import javax.persistence.criteria.CriteriaQuery;
import javax.persistence.criteria.Root;

@Stateless
public class OrderService {

  @Inject
  private EntityManager em;

  public void save(Order order) {
    em.persist(order);
  }

  public List<Order> getOrders() {
    CriteriaBuilder cb = em.getCriteriaBuilder();
    CriteriaQuery<Order> criteria = cb.createQuery(Order.class);
    Root<Order> member = criteria.from(Order.class);
    criteria.select(member);
    return em.createQuery(criteria).getResultList();
  }

  public Order getOrderById(long id) {
    return em.find(Order.class, id);
  }
}
```

### Issue 5

Line number: 9
### Issue 6
Issue to fix: "Replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence` "
Line number: 10
### Issue 7
Issue to fix: "In JavaEE/JakartaEE, using `@PersistenceContext` was needed in order to inject a data source. Quarkus, on the other hand,
 will create the bean automatically just by correctly setting up your datasource. This makes having a `@Produces` annotation
 on the `EntityManager` illegal in Quarkus.
 
 If you are using a `@Produces` annotation for your EntityManager, and it is not needed after configuring your datasource, remove it and `@Inject` the EntityManager.
 Otherwise, if the producer is still needed, please create a qualification for your produced `EntityManager`, as well as every injection point for the EM.
 
 For instance, you can create an `ExtendedContext` qualifier:
 ```
 @Qualifier
 @Target()
 @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
 public @interface ExtendedContext 
 ```
 and then inject your entity managers:
 ```
 @ExtendedContext
 public EntityManager getEm() 
 ```"
Line number: 7
### Issue 8
Issue to fix: "Stateless EJBs can be converted to a cdi bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope eg `@ApplicationScoped`
 "
Line number: 12
