## Reasoning

1. **Understanding the issue:** The issue here is about session replication in a clustered environment. In a Java EE application, session replication ensures that client sessions are not disrupted by node failure. However, in a cloud environment, data in the memory of a running container can be wiped out by a restart.

2. **Impact on Quarkus migration:** Quarkus is a cloud-native framework and does not support Java EE's XML configuration files like `web.xml`. Therefore, we need to migrate this configuration to Quarkus' native configuration.

3. **Session replication in Quarkus:** Quarkus does not support session replication out of the box. We need to use a distributed data grid like Infinispan or Hazelcast for session data replication.

4. **Disabling session replication:** Since Quarkus does not support session replication, we need to disable it. This can be done by removing the `<distributable>` tag from the configuration.

5. **Impact on pom.xml:** Since we are not using any remote data grid, there is no impact on the `pom.xml` file.

6. **Impact on imports:** Since we are not using any new libraries, there is no impact on imports.

## Updated File

```xml
<!-- This file is not used in Quarkus. Session replication needs to be configured in the application code. -->
```

## Additional Information

1. To configure session replication in Quarkus, you can refer to the Quarkus documentation: [Configuring Session Management](https://quarkus.io/guides/http-reference#session-management)

2. If you decide to use a remote data grid like Infinispan or Hazelcast, you need to add the corresponding dependency in the `pom.xml` file and configure it in the `application.properties` file.

3. If you decide to disable session replication, you can simply remove the `<distributable>` tag from the `web.xml` file. In Quarkus, you can configure session management in the `application.properties` file.
