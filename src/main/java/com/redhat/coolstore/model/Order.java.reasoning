["The issue here is related to the migration from `javax.persistence` to `jakarta.persistence` package. The Javax packages in Java are being replaced by Jakarta packages in newer versions of Java, including Quarkus. This is a consequence of the transfer of Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation, where it has been renamed to Jakarta EE. So, for the migration, we have to replace the import statements from `javax.persistence` to `jakarta.persistence`.\n\nWe also need to ensure that the associated dependencies in the `pom.xml` are updated to use the Jakarta versions."]
