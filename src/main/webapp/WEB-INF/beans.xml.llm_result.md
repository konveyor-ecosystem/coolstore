## Reasoning

1. The first three issues (Issue 1, Issue 2, Issue 3) are related to updating the XML namespace from `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` to `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee`. This change is necessary because Java EE has been rebranded to Jakarta EE, and the new namespace reflects this change.

2. Issue 4 requires updating the schema version number from `beans_1_1.xsd` to `beans_3_0.xsd` and changing the version attribute to `"3.0"`. This change is necessary because Quarkus supports CDI 3.0, which is the latest version of Contexts and Dependency Injection for Java.

3. Issue 5 suggests removing the `beans.xml` descriptor from the application. This is because Quarkus supports CDI out of the box, and the `beans.xml` descriptor is not necessary. However, if there are specific configurations in the `beans.xml` file that are required, they can be moved to `application.properties` or `application.yml` files.

## Updated File

```xml
<!-- This file can be an empty text file (0 bytes) -->
<!-- We're declaring the schema to save you time if you do have to configure 
   this in the future -->
<beans xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
   xsi:schemaLocation="
      https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee
      https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/beans_3_0.xsd" bean-discovery-mode="all">
</beans>
```

## Additional Information

If there are no specific configurations in the `beans.xml` file that are required, it is recommended to remove the file from the application. This will simplify the application and reduce the risk of configuration errors. If specific configurations are required, they can be moved to `application.properties` or `application.yml` files.

Additionally, it is important to note that Quarkus supports CDI 3.0, which includes several new features and improvements over previous versions. It is recommended to review the CDI 3.0 specification and update the application to take advantage of these new features.
