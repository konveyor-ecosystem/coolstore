## Reasoning

1. The issue states that we need to replace `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` and update the schema version number. This is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace for XML configurations.
2. We also need to replace `beans_1_1.xsd` with `beans_3_0.xsd` and update the version attribute to `"3.0"` to align with the Jakarta EE 3.0 schema version.
3. The issue mentions that the `beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored in Quarkus and could be removed from the application. This is because Quarkus provides CDI features differently and does not rely on the `beans.xml` file for configuration.

## Additional Information

The `beans.xml` descriptor content can be safely removed from the application as Quarkus does not rely on it for CDI configuration.
