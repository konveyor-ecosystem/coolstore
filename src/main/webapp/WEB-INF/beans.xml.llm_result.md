## Reasoning

1. The first step is to address the issues found from the static source code analysis. The first three issues are related to replacing the XML namespace from `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` to `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee`. This change is necessary because the Java EE namespace has been migrated to the Jakarta EE namespace.

2. The fourth issue is to replace the schema version number `beans_1_1.xsd` with `beans_3_0.xsd` and update the version attribute to `"3.0"`. This change is necessary to reflect the updated CDI specification version.

3. The fifth issue is to remove the `beans.xml` descriptor as it is not required in Quarkus and its content is ignored. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses a different mechanism for CDI configuration.

## Updated File

The updated file for Quarkus is an empty text file as indicated in the solved example provided for issue 5.

## Additional Information

1. In Quarkus, CDI is enabled by default and there is no need for a `beans.xml` file.

2. The `beans.xml` file is used in Java EE to configure CDI, but in Quarkus, CDI configuration is done through code using extensions or annotations.

3. The `beans.xml` file can be removed from the application directory as it is not required in Quarkus.

4. It is important to update the external dependencies in the `pom.xml` file to reflect the migration to Quarkus. This includes updating the dependencies to the Jakarta EE versions and removing any Java EE specific dependencies.

5. The imports in the Java code may also need to be updated to reflect the migration to Quarkus. This includes updating the imports to use the Jakarta EE packages instead of the Java EE packages.

6. It is recommended to thoroughly test the application after migrating to Quarkus to ensure that it is functioning as expected.

## Reasoning

1. The first step is to address the issues found from the static source code analysis. The first three issues are related to the namespace of the XML schema. The current namespace is `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` and we need to replace it with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` as per the instructions.

2. The fourth issue is about changing the schema version number from `beans_1_1.xsd` to `beans_3_0.xsd` and updating the version attribute to `"3.0"`.

3. The last issue is about the content of the `beans.xml` descriptor being ignored in Quarkus. This means that we can remove the `beans.xml` file from the application. However, for the sake of understanding the changes, I will show the updated `beans.xml` file with the changes from the first four issues.

## Additional Information

As mentioned earlier, the `beans.xml` file is not required in Quarkus and can be removed from the application. However, if you want to keep the `beans.xml` file for documentation purposes, you can add a comment indicating that the file is not required in Quarkus.

```xml
<!-- This file is not required in Quarkus -->
```

Additionally, you can refer to the Quarkus documentation for more information on CDI in Quarkus.
