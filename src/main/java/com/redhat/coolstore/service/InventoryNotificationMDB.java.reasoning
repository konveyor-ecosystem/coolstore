["1. The issue found in the static code analysis is that the import statement `javax.inject` needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject` to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. Quarkus follows the Jakarta EE specification, so we need to update the import statement to use the Jakarta EE namespace.\n3. We also need to ensure that any dependencies or imports related to Jakarta EE are updated accordingly in the pom.xml file.", "1. The static code analysis highlighted the issue of replacing JMS `Topic`s with Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel.\n2. The `Topic` declaration in the Java EE code needs to be replaced with an `Emitter` declaration in the Quarkus code.\n3. We need to update the `InventoryNotificationMDB` class to use Quarkus annotations and features.\n4. The `@Inject` annotation can be used to inject dependencies in Quarkus.\n5. The JNDI lookup and naming related code needs to be updated to work with Quarkus.", "1. The issue identified in the static code analysis is related to the usage of JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements in the code, which need to be replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents.\n2. The code currently uses `javax.jms.MessageListener` which is a JavaEE/JakartaEE interface and needs to be updated to use a corresponding Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile alternative."]
