["1. The issue found in the static code analysis is that the import statement for `javax.ejb` needs to be replaced with `jakarta.ejb`.\n2. Quarkus is based on the Jakarta EE specifications, so it uses the Jakarta namespace instead of the javax namespace for EE APIs.\n3. We need to update the import statement from `javax.ejb.Stateless` to `jakarta.ejb.Stateless`.", "1. The primary issue to address is to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject` as per the static code analysis.\n2. Update the import statement from `jakarta.ejb.Stateless` to `jakarta.inject.Inject`.\n3. Ensure that there are no other dependencies or imports that need to be updated in the file.\n4. Make sure to update the pom.xml file with any necessary dependencies for Quarkus.", "1. The issue identified from static code analysis is that the `@Stateless` annotation needs to be replaced with a scope annotation in Quarkus, such as `@ApplicationScoped`.\n2. We need to update the import statement for `@Stateless` to `@ApplicationScoped`.\n3. We need to update the import statement for the CDI `@Inject` annotation from `javax.inject.Inject` to `jakarta.inject.Inject`.\n4. Since no solved example is provided, we will directly make the necessary changes to the input Java EE file to migrate it to Quarkus."]
