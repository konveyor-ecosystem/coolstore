## Reasoning

1. The first issue to address is replacing the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specification, which uses the `jakarta` namespace instead of the `javax` namespace used in Java EE.

2. The `javax.inject.Inject` annotation is used to inject the `Logger` object in the `StartupListener` class. We need to replace this import statement with `jakarta.inject.Inject` to use the Jakarta EE specification.

3. The `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener` interface is used to listen for application lifecycle events in WebLogic Server. This interface is not available in Quarkus, so we need to replace it with an equivalent interface that is available in Quarkus.

4. The `weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent` class is used to represent application lifecycle events in WebLogic Server. This class is not available in Quarkus, so we need to replace it with an equivalent class that is available in Quarkus.

5. The `java.util.logging.Logger` class is used to log messages in the `StartupListener` class. This class is available in Quarkus, so we can continue to use it.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import io.quarkus.runtime.ShutdownEvent;
import io.quarkus.runtime.StartupEvent;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class StartupListener {

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    void onStart(StartupEvent ev) {
        log.info("AppListener(postStart)");
    }

    void onStop(ShutdownEvent ev) {
        log.info("AppListener(preStop)");
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

1. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Startup` and `@Shutdown` annotations to listen for application startup and shutdown events, respectively. These annotations are provided by the `io.quarkus.runtime` package.

2. The `onStart` and `onStop` methods are used to handle the application startup and shutdown events, respectively. These methods replace the `postStart` and `preStop` methods used in the original `StartupListener` class.

3. The `@Inject` annotation is used to inject the `Logger` object in the updated `StartupListener` class. This annotation is provided by the `jakarta.inject` package.

4. The `java.util.logging.Logger` class is used to log messages in the updated `StartupListener` class. This class is available in Quarkus, so we can continue to use it.

5. The `pom.xml` file does not need to be updated for this migration step.
