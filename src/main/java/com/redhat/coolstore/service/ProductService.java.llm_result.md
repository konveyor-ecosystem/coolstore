## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1:** The `javax.ejb` package is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent Jakarta EE package `jakarta.ejb` for compatibility with Quarkus.

2. **Issue 2:** The `javax.inject` package is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent Jakarta EE package `jakarta.inject` for compatibility with Quarkus.

3. **Issue 3:** Stateless EJBs are not supported in Quarkus. Instead, we can use CDI beans with a suitable scope, such as `@ApplicationScoped`.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.CatalogItemEntity;
import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Product;
import com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;

import jakarta.ejb.LocalBean;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

@LocalBean
@ApplicationScoped
public class ProductService {

    @Inject
    CatalogService cm;

    public ProductService() {
    }

    public List<Product> getProducts() {
        return cm.getCatalogItems().stream().map(entity -> toProduct(entity)).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    public Product getProductByItemId(String itemId) {
        CatalogItemEntity entity = cm.getCatalogItemById(itemId);
        if (entity == null)
            return null;

        // Return the entity
        return Transformers.toProduct(entity);
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

In this case, we only needed to update the annotations and import statements. There are no external dependencies to update in the `pom.xml` file. However, if there were any, they would need to be updated accordingly. For example, if there were any dependencies on `javax.ejb` or `javax.inject`, they would need to be updated to use the Jakarta EE equivalents. Additionally, if any other Java EE annotations were used, they would need to be replaced with their Quarkus/CDI equivalents.
