## Reasoning

The first two issues are related to the import statements. In Quarkus, the `javax.ws` package has been replaced with `jakarta.ws`. So, we need to replace the import statements accordingly.

The last two issues are related to the JAX-RS activation. In Quarkus, JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary. We can set a root path, but it's not mandatory. So, we can remove the `@ApplicationPath` annotation and the `extends Application` statement.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;

public class RestApplication {

}
```

## Additional Information (optional)

After updating the file, we need to make sure that the `jakarta.ws.rs-api` dependency is included in the `pom.xml` file. If it's not there, we need to add it.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.ws.rs</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.ws.rs-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.6</version>
</dependency>
```

Also, we need to make sure that the Quarkus extension for RESTEasy is included in the `pom.xml` file. If it's not there, we need to add it.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-resteasy</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

After making these changes, we need to rebuild the project to make sure that everything works as expected.
