## Reasoning

1. The first step is to understand the issue. The issue is to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is because Java EE libraries use the `javax` package namespace while Quarkus uses the `jakarta` package namespace.

2. The next step is to identify the import statement that needs to be changed. In this case, it is the import statement on line 6: `import javax.inject.Inject;`

3. We need to replace this import statement with the Quarkus equivalent: `import jakarta.inject.Inject;`

4. We also need to ensure that the `@Inject` annotation is still valid after the import change. Since `@Inject` is a standard JSR-330 dependency injection annotation, it should be valid in both Java EE and Quarkus.

5. There are no external dependencies or imports that need to be updated in the pom.xml file for this change.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class StartupListener {

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    public void postStart(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {
        log.info("AppListener(postStart)");
    }

    public void preStop(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {
        log.info("AppListener(preStop)");
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

There are no additional steps or information needed for this migration. The updated file above only includes the necessary changes to migrate the `javax.inject` import statement to `jakarta.inject`. Other issues will be addressed in subsequent steps.
