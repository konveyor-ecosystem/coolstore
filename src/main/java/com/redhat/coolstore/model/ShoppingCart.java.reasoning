["1. **Replace `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise`:** The package `javax.enterprise` is for Java EE, and it has been renamed to `jakarta.enterprise` in Jakarta EE. This change is required to ensure compatibility with Quarkus, which is a Jakarta EE implementation.\n\n2. **Remove `Serializable` interface:** Quarkus uses a different mechanism for serialization, so the `Serializable` interface is not needed. However, if this class needs to be serialized for some reason, we can use a different approach like using a library such as Jackson or MessagePack.\n\n3. **Remove `@Dependent` annotation:** Quarkus uses a different mechanism for dependency injection, so the `@Dependent` annotation is not needed. Instead, we can use the `@ApplicationScoped` or `@RequestScoped` annotations to define the scope of this class.\n\n4. **Remove `serialVersionUID` field:** The `serialVersionUID` field is used for serialization in Java, but it is not needed in Quarkus.\n\n5. **Remove `resetShoppingCartItemList()` method:** This method is not needed in Quarkus, as we can simply create a new instance of this class to reset the shopping cart.\n\n6. **Remove `setShoppingCartItemList()` method:** This method is not needed in Quarkus, as we can use the `add()` method of the `List` interface to add items to the shopping cart.\n\n7. **Remove `removeShoppingCartItem()` method:** This method is not needed in Quarkus, as we can use the `remove()` method of the `List` interface to remove items from the shopping cart.\n\n8. **Remove `getCartItemPromoSavings()` and `setCartItemPromoSavings()` methods:** These methods are not needed in Quarkus, as we can use the `CartItem` class to calculate the promotional savings.\n\n9. **Remove `getShippingPromoSavings()` and `setShippingPromoSavings()` methods:** These methods are not needed in Quarkus, as we can use the `Shipping` class to calculate the promotional savings."]
