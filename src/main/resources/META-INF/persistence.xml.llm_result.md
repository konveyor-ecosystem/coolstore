## Reasoning

1. The first issue to address is updating the XML schema for the `persistence.xml` file. This involves changing the XML namespace from `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence` to `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence` and updating the schema version number from `2.1` to `3.0`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace instead of the JCP namespace.

2. The second issue to address is renaming properties prefixed by `javax` with `jakarta`. This is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace instead of the JCP namespace.

3. The third issue to address is moving persistence related configuration from an XML file to a properties one. This allows centralization of the configuration in Quarkus. It is recommended to move persistence related configuration from an XML file to a properties one. This allows centralization of the configuration in Quarkus.

## Updated File

It is not possible to provide a full output of the updated file in this format, as the updated file would be a properties file instead of an XML file. However, here is an example of how the updated file would look like:

```
quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:h2:mem:tasks-jsf-quickstart;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1
quarkus.datasource.db-kind=h2
quarkus.datasource.username=sa
quarkus.datasource.password=sa

quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation=drop-and-create
```

## Additional Information

It is important to note that the updated file would need to be placed in the `src/main/resources` directory of the Quarkus project, and the `META-INF/persistence.xml` file would need to be removed. Additionally, the Quarkus project would need to have the appropriate dependencies added to the `pom.xml` file, such as the Hibernate ORM and H2 Database dependencies.
