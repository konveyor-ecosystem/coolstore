["The Java EE code is using the `javax.ejb.Stateless` and `javax.inject.Inject` annotations and these are not supported in Quarkus. The `javax.ejb.Stateless` annotation needs to be replaced with `javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped` because the Stateless annotation is used to define a stateless session bean and that is not supported in Quarkus. The `javax.inject.Inject` annotation needs to be replaced with `javax.enterprise.inject.Instance` because Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection and does not support the `javax.inject.Inject` annotation. \n\nSo, the steps to update the code are:\n\n1. Replace the `javax.ejb.Stateless` annotation with `javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped`\n2. Replace the `javax.inject.Inject` annotation with `javax.enterprise.inject.Instance`\n3. Replace the import statements with the correct ones.\n\nThe `pom.xml` file needs to be updated to include the dependency for `jakarta.inject` and `jakarta.ejb` to replace the `javax.ejb` and `javax.inject` dependencies."]
