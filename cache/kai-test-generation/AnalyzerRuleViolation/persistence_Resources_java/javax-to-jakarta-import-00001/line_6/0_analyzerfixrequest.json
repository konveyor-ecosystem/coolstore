The current import statement is `jakarta.persistence.EntityManager`, but the incident suggests replacing `javax.persistence` with `jakarta.persistence`. However, since the code is already using `jakarta.persistence`, this incident seems to be a false positive.\n\nBut, considering the context of migrating to Jakarta EE, we should ensure that all the dependencies in the `pom.xml` are updated to use the Jakarta EE namespace instead of the Java EE namespace.\n\nNo changes are required in the `Resources.java` file. However, we should verify that the `pom.xml` file has the correct dependencies.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.persistence;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;\nimport jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;\n\n@Dependent\npublic class Resources {\n\n    private EntityManager em;\n\n    public Resources(EntityManager em) {\n        this.em = em;\n    }\n\n    public EntityManager getEntityManager() {\n        return em;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nTo complete the migration to Jakarta EE, we should update the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file to use the Jakarta EE namespace. For example, we should replace `javax.persistence:javax.persistence-api` with `jakarta.persistence:jakarta.persistence-api`. \n\nHere's an example of how the updated dependency might look:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.persistence</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.persistence-api</artifactId>\n    <version>3.0.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nPlease note that the actual version of the dependency might vary depending on the specific requirements of your project.",
