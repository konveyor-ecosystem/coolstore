Model ID: gpt-4
## Reasoning

The issues identified in the `beans.xml` file are related to the namespace and schema version used in the file. The namespace `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` is outdated and should be replaced with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee`. The schema version `beans_1_1.xsd` is also outdated and should be replaced with `beans_3_0.xsd`.

However, in Quarkus, the `beans.xml` descriptor is not required and its content is ignored. Quarkus has a different approach to CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) and does not require the `beans.xml` file for enabling CDI. Therefore, the `beans.xml` file can be removed from the application.

## Updated File

The `beans.xml` file should be removed from the application. There is no need to update the file for Quarkus.

```xml
<!-- The beans.xml file is not required in Quarkus and should be removed from the application. -->
```

## Additional Information (optional)

After removing the `beans.xml` file, you should check the application to ensure that all CDI features are working as expected. You can refer to the Quarkus guide on CDI to understand how CDI is handled in Quarkus.
