## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 to 4:** The JavaEE packages `javax.annotation`, `javax.ejb`, `javax.inject`, and `javax.jms` need to be updated to their JakartaEE equivalents (`jakarta.annotation`, `jakarta.ejb`, `jakarta.inject`, and `jakarta.jms`) as part of the migration process from JavaEE to JakartaEE APIs.

2. **Issue 5 and 6:** JMS `Topic`s should be replaced with Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel. This is a Quarkus-specific approach to managing topics and messages.

3. **Issue 7:** Same as issue 5 and 6, replace the JMS `Topic` with a Micrometer `Emitter` feeding a Channel.

4. **Issue 8 and 9:** References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. This is a continuation of the migration process from JavaEE to JakartaEE APIs.

5. **Issue 10:** Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`. This is because Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection, and the `@Stateless` annotation is not recognized in Quarkus.

## Updated File

@ApplicationScoped
public class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {

    @Inject
    Logger log;


    @Inject
    private transient JMSContext context;

    @Resource(lookup = "java:/topic/orders")
    @Channel("orders")
    Emitter<String> ordersEmitter;

    
  
    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {
        log.info("Sending order from processor: ");
        ordersEmitter.send(Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart));
    }



}
```

## Additional Information

In the updated file, we have replaced the JavaEE packages with their JakartaEE equivalents, and replaced the JMS `Topic`s with Micrometer `Emitter`s feeding a Channel. We also replaced the `@Stateless` annotation with `@ApplicationScoped` to convert the Stateless EJB to a CDI bean.

Note that the `@Channel` annotation is used to specify the name of the channel, and the `Emitter` is used to send messages to the channel. The `Multi` type is used to represent a reactive stream of messages, but in this case, we are only sending a single message, so we don't need to use it.

Additionally, the `Transformers.shoppingCartToJson(cart)` method is used to convert the `ShoppingCart` object to a JSON string before sending it to the channel. This method is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the codebase.
