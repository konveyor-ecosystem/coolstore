## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 and 2:** The Java EE specification has been updated to Eclipse Jakarta EE, which means the package names have changed from `javax` to `jakarta`. This is a breaking change and needs to be addressed. In this case, we need to change the import statements from `javax.enterprise.inject` to `jakarta.enterprise.inject`.

2. **Issue 3:** In Quarkus, CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) beans can be simplified. The `@Produces` annotation is not needed if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier. In this case, the `produceLog` method is not used anywhere else, so we can remove the `@Produces` annotation and use a `@Named` getter method instead. This will simplify the code and make it more Quarkus-friendly.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
import jakarta.inject.Named;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Producers {

    Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());

    @Named
    public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

In this updated file, we have changed the import statements from `javax.enterprise.inject` to `jakarta.enterprise.inject`. We have also removed the `@Produces` annotation and added the `@Named` annotation to the `produceLog` method. This will allow us to use the `produceLog` method as a CDI bean and inject it into other classes.

Note that we have not made any changes to the `pom.xml` file, as there are no external dependencies that need to be updated. However, if there were any external dependencies that needed to be updated, we would need to update the `pom.xml` file accordingly. For example, if we were using the `javax.enterprise.api` dependency, we would need to update it to `jakarta.enterprise.api` in the `pom.xml` file.
