The issue found in the static code analysis is that the import statements are using `jakarta.persistence` instead of `javax.persistence`. This needs to be fixed in order to migrate to Quarkus.\n2.

The `pom.xml` file should also be updated to include the necessary dependencies for Quarkus.", "1. The issue identified from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.persistence` import statements with `jakarta.persistence`. This is necessary because Quarkus uses Jakarta EE specifications instead of Java EE specifications.", "1. The static code analysis highlighted the issue of replacing the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`.\n2. To migrate the Java EE code to Quarkus, we need to update all the `javax.persistence` imports to `jakarta.persistence`.\n3. We will make the necessary changes in the `InventoryEntity.java` file to replace the `javax.persistence` imports with `jakarta.persistence`.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.xml` import statement with `jakarta.xml`.\n2. We need to update the import statements for `XmlRootElement` from `javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement` to `jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement`.\n3. Quarkus is based on Jakarta EE specifications, so we need to make these changes to align with the Jakarta EE namespace."]
