## Reasoning

1. Review the session replication usage and ensure that it is configured properly: The provided `web.xml` file does not contain any configuration for session replication. Therefore, it is not possible to review the current configuration.
2. Disable HTTP session clustering and accept its implications: Since there is no session replication configured, it can be assumed that session clustering is not enabled. However, to ensure that session clustering is disabled, we can add a `<session-config>` element with a `<session-timeout>` element to the `web.xml` file.
3. Re-architect the application so that sessions are stored in a cache backing service or a remote data grid: This is a significant architectural change that is beyond the scope of this migration step. Therefore, we will not address this recommendation in this step.

## Updated File

Based on the reasoning above, we will add a `<session-config>` element with a `<session-timeout>` element to the `web.xml` file to ensure that session clustering is disabled.

```xml
<!--suppress ServletWithoutMappingInspection -->
<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd"
         version="3.0">
    <distributable />
    <session-config>
        <session-timeout>1</session-timeout>
    </session-config>
</web-app>
```
