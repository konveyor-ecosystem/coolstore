["Here are my step by step reasonings on migrating the Java EE code to Quarkus:\n\n1. **Issue 1** - In Quarkus, Java EE namespaces have been replaced with Jakarta EE namespaces. Therefore, `javax.ejb` should be replaced with `jakarta.ejb`. However, in Quarkus, EJB is not supported. Instead, we use CDI beans. The `@Stateless` annotation from `javax.ejb` will be replaced by `@ApplicationScoped` from `javax.enterprise.context`. No changes are necessary in the `pom.xml` as this uses standard CDI which is included in Quarkus.\n\n2. **Issue 2** - Similar to Issue 1, `javax.inject` should be replaced with `jakarta.inject`. This change is necessary because of the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE. No changes are necessary in the `pom.xml` for this, as Quarkus already includes the necessary dependencies.\n\n3. **Issue 3, 4, 5, 6** - `javax.persistence` should be replaced with `jakarta.persistence` as part of the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE. No changes are necessary in the `pom.xml` for this, as Quarkus already includes the necessary dependencies.\n\n4. **Issue 7** - In Quarkus, you can directly `@Inject` the `EntityManager` without needing a producer. Therefore, we will remove the `@Inject` annotation on the `EntityManager` field. If multiple `EntityManager`s are needed, we would need to create a qualifier as suggested in the issue description. But since in our case, we only need one `EntityManager`, we do not need to create a qualifier. No changes are necessary in the `pom.xml` for this.\n\n5. **Issue 8** - Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`. This change is necessary as EJB is not supported in Quarkus. No changes are necessary in the `pom.xml` for this, as this uses standard CDI which is included in Quarkus."]
