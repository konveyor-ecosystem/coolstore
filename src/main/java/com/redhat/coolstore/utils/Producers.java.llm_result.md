## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 and 2:** The Java EE specification has been updated to Eclipse Jakarta EE, which means the package names have changed from `javax` to `jakarta`. This is a breaking change and needs to be addressed. In this case, we need to change the import statements from `javax.enterprise.inject` to `jakarta.enterprise.inject`.

2. **Issue 3:** In Quarkus, CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) beans can be simplified. The `@Produces` annotation is not needed if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier. In this case, the `produceLog` method is not used anywhere else, so we can simplify it by removing the `@Produces` annotation and adding a `@Singleton` annotation to make it a singleton bean.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import jakarta.enterprise.inject.Default;
import jakarta.enterprise.inject.Produces;
import jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

@Default
@Singleton
public class Producers {

    Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());

    public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

1. We added the `@Default` annotation to make this bean the default implementation of the `Producers` interface.
2. We added the `@Singleton` annotation to make this bean a singleton.
3. We removed the `@Produces` annotation from the `produceLog` method.
4. We kept the `injectionPoint` parameter in the `produceLog` method, but it is not used in this example. It could be used to configure the logger based on the injection point.
5. We did not change the `Logger` class, as it is not part of the Java EE or Jakarta EE specification. It is a standard Java class from the `java.util.logging` package.
6. We did not change the `com.redhat.coolstore.utils` package name, as it is not part of the issue. However, it is recommended to follow the package naming conventions and use a group identifier, such as `com.redhat.coolstore.utils`.
7. We did not change the `log` field, as it is not part of the issue. However, it is recommended to use a constructor or a method to initialize the logger, instead of a field.
8. We did not change the `getLogger` method, as it is not part of the issue. However, it is recommended to use a logger factory or a logger provider, instead of the static `getLogger` method.
9. We did not change the `injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName()` expression, as it is not part of the issue. However, it is recommended to use a qualifier or a stereotype, instead of the injection point.
10. We did not change the `Producers` class name, as it is not part of the issue. However, it is recommended to use a more descriptive name, such as `LoggerProducers`.
11. We did not change the `com.redhat.coolstore` group identifier, as it is not part of the issue. However, it is recommended to use a group identifier that follows the Maven group identifier naming conventions, such as `org.redhat.coolstore`.
12. We did not change the `pom.xml` file, as it is not part of the issue. However, it is recommended to update the `pom.xml` file to use the `jakarta.ee` group identifier, instead of the `javax.ee` group identifier.
