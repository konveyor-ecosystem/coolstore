The `@Produces` annotation on the `getEntityManager` method is not allowed in Quarkus, as Quarkus does not support CDI producers for `EntityManager`.\n3. To fix the issue, we need to remove the `@PersistenceContext` annotation and the `@Produces` annotation, and instead, inject the `EntityManager` using `@Inject`.\n4. If a producer method is still needed, we should create a qualifier annotation and use it for both the producer method and injection points.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.persistence;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;\n\n@Dependent\npublic class Resources {\n\n    @Inject\n    private EntityManager em;\n\n    // If a producer method is still needed, create a qualifier annotation\n    // For example, @ExtendedContext\n    // @ExtendedContext\n    // public EntityManager getEm() {\n    //     return em;\n    // }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNo additional steps are required for this specific issue.",
