## Reasoning

1. First, we need to understand the issue. The issue is about session replication in a clustered environment and how it can cause problems in a cloud environment. The recommended solutions are to review the session replication configuration, disable it and accept its implications, or re-architect the application to store sessions in a remote data grid.
2. In the case of migrating to Quarkus, we will assume that the recommendation is to disable session replication and store sessions in a remote data grid. Quarkus does not support session replication out of the box, so this is a good opportunity to remove this configuration.
3. To disable session replication, we need to remove the `<distributable>` tag from the `web.xml` file. This tag is used to indicate that the web application is distributable and that session replication should be used.
4. Since Quarkus does not use a `web.xml` file, we will also remove the entire `web.xml` file. Instead, Quarkus uses a different configuration mechanism, such as application.properties or application.yml.
5. Since we are removing the `web.xml` file, we need to make sure that there are no external dependencies in the `pom.xml` file that rely on it. In this case, there are no such dependencies, so no changes are needed in the `pom.xml` file.

## Additional Information

* Since Quarkus does not use a `web.xml` file, you will need to configure your application using other mechanisms, such as application.properties or application.yml.
* If you need to store sessions in a remote data grid, you will need to integrate your Quarkus application with a data grid solution, such as Infinispan or Hazelcast.
* If you have any other configurations in the `web.xml` file, you will need to migrate them to the appropriate configuration mechanism in Quarkus.
