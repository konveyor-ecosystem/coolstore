      "content": "## Reasoning\nThe issue to be fixed is related to the migration of a Jakarta EE application to Quarkus. The `@Stateless` annotation is typically used in Jakarta EE to define a stateless session bean. However, in this case, the annotation is missing from the provided code. \n\nDespite the missing annotation, the task is to replace it with a scope annotation, such as `@ApplicationScoped`, to convert the stateless EJB to a CDI bean. This is because Quarkus uses CDI (Context and Dependency Injection) for bean management.\n\nHowever, before making any changes, we need to consider the impact on the existing code. The `@Inject` and `@Named` annotations are already being used, which suggests that the class is already being managed by CDI.\n\nGiven the information provided, we can proceed with adding the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to the class. This will define the scope of the bean and make it eligible for injection.\n\nWe also need to consider the imports. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is part of the CDI specification, so we need to ensure that the correct import statement is added.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport jakarta.inject.Named;\nimport jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;\nimport jakarta.persistence.criteria.CriteriaBuilder;\nimport jakarta.persistence.criteria.CriteriaQuery;\nimport jakarta.persistence.criteria.Root;\n\n@ApplicationScoped\npublic class OrderService {\n\n  @Inject\n  @Named(\"entityManagerFactory\") // Define the name of the persistence unit\n  private EntityManager em;\n\n  public void save(Order order) {\n    em.persist(order);\n  }\n\n  public List<Order> getOrders() {\n    CriteriaBuilder cb = em.getCriteriaBuilder();\n    CriteriaQuery<Order> criteria = cb.createQuery(Order.class);\n    Root<Order> member = criteria.from(Order.class);\n    criteria.select(member);\n    return em.createQuery(criteria).getResultList();\n  }\n\n  public Order getOrderById(long id) {\n    return em.find(Order.class, id);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNo additional changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific issue. However, when migrating the entire application to Quarkus, you will need to update the dependencies to use Quarkus-specific dependencies instead of Jakarta EE dependencies.\n\nFor example, you will need to replace the `jakarta.persistence-api` dependency with the `io.quarkus:quarkus-hibernate-orm` dependency, and update the `jakarta.enterprise.cdi-api` dependency to use the `io.quarkus:quarkus-arc` dependency.\n\nAdditionally, you may need to configure the Quarkus application using the `application.properties` file or the `application.yml` file, depending on your specific requirements.",
