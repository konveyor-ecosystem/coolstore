["First, we need to change the `javax.enterprise` import to `jakarta.enterprise` to align it with the latest Jakarta EE APIs that Quarkus is using. \n\nSecond, we need to change the `javax.inject` import to `jakarta.inject` for the same reason.\n\nNext, we need to replace all the `javax.ws` imports with `jakarta.ws` because Quarkus uses the latest Jakarta RESTful Web Services API.\n\nQuarkus uses CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) for all its injection points, so the `@Inject` annotation will still work perfectly.\n\nThe `@SessionScoped` annotation from Java EE is replaced in Quarkus by `@RequestScoped`. The reason for this is that Quarkus, as a Cloud-native Java stack, is designed to work statelessly, which means it doesn't maintain a session state like a traditional Java EE application server would do.\n\nThe `@Path`, `@GET`, `@POST`, `@DELETE`, `@PathParam`, `@Produces` and `@Path` annotations are part of the JAX-RS specification (now Jakarta RESTful Web Services) so they will work the same way in Quarkus."]
