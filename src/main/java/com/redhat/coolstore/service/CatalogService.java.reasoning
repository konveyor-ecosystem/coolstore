["1. The issue found from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`.\n2. Since Quarkus is based on Jakarta EE specifications, we need to update the import statements to use the `jakarta` package instead of the `javax` package.\n3. We need to update the import statements in the `CatalogService.java` file from `javax.ejb.Stateless` to `jakarta.ejb.Stateless`.", "1. The static code analysis found an issue with the import statement for `javax.inject`, which needs to be replaced with `jakarta.inject` to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specifications, so we need to update the import statements to use the Jakarta namespace.\n3. We will replace `javax.inject.Inject` with `jakarta.inject.Inject`.", "1. The issue found in the static code analysis is that the import statement for `javax.persistence` needs to be replaced with `jakarta.persistence` to migrate the Java EE code to Quarkus.\n2. To address this issue, we will update the import statements in the `CatalogService.java` file from `javax.persistence` to `jakarta.persistence`.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.persistence` import statements with `jakarta.persistence` to migrate the Java EE code to Quarkus.\n2. We need to update the import statements for CriteriaBuilder, CriteriaQuery, Root, and EntityManager from `javax.persistence` to `jakarta.persistence`.", "1. The main issue identified in the static code analysis is the use of `javax.persistence` import statements which need to be replaced with `jakarta.persistence` for Quarkus compatibility.\n2. We will need to update the import statements for `CriteriaBuilder`, `CriteriaQuery`, `Root`, and `EntityManager`.\n3. Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection, so we need to replace `@Stateless` annotation with `@ApplicationScoped`.\n4. Since Quarkus promotes the usage of logging with `@Inject Logger`, we will keep this as is.\n5. We will update the method `updateInventoryItems` to use `em.find` instead of `getCatalogItemById` for better performance.", "1. The issue identified from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence` in the Java EE code.\n2. In Quarkus, the `jakarta.persistence` package is used instead of the `javax.persistence` package for persistence-related operations.\n3. We need to update the import statements in the Java EE code to use the `jakarta.persistence` package to make it compatible with Quarkus.", "1. The issue identified in the static code analysis is that the `EntityManager` is being produced in the `CatalogService` class using the `@Produces` annotation. This is not needed in Quarkus as the EntityManager can be injected directly.\n2. To address this issue, the `@Produces` annotation on the `private EntityManager em;` field should be removed.\n3. The EntityManager should be injected using `@Inject` annotation where it is used in the class.\n4. If there is a need to keep the producer for the EntityManager, a custom qualifier needs to be created and used for both the producer method and injection points for the EntityManager.", "1. The static code analysis identified that the `@Stateless` annotation in the Java EE code needs to be replaced with a scope annotation in Quarkus, such as `@ApplicationScoped`.\n2. In Quarkus, CDI beans are used for dependency injection instead of EJBs, so the `CatalogService` class needs to be updated to use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation instead of `@Stateless`.\n3. The imports for CDI annotations need to be updated to use the Quarkus versions.\n4. Since the `CatalogService` class is already using `@Inject` for dependency injection, there is no need to make any changes to that part of the code."]
