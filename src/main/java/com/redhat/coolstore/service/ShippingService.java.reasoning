["This Java EE file is a Stateless EJB in a remote interface. This is being used as a service to calculate shipping costs and insurance based on the total cost of items in a shopping cart.\n\nQuarkus does not support EJBs, so we need to convert this EJB into a CDI bean and convert the remote interfaces into RESTful web services.\n\n1. We will replace the `@Stateless` annotation with `@ApplicationScoped` to make this a CDI bean.\n2. We will replace `@Remote` annotation with a `@Path(\"/shipping\")` annotation to make it a RESTful web service.\n3. We will replace the `javax.ejb` imports with `jakarta.ejb` as indicated by the static analysis.\n4. For each public method, we will add an `@GET` annotation to make it accessible as a GET HTTP method and add a `@Path(\"<methodName>\")` annotation to specify the path to access the method.\n5. We need to replace the argument of the methods with `@QueryParam(\"sc\") ShoppingCart sc` to pass `ShoppingCart` as a query parameter.\n\nAs for the pom.xml, we need to add the Quarkus RESTEasy extension to enable RESTful web services. Also, the `jakarta.ejb-api` dependency should be replaced with `jakarta.enterprise.cdi-api` for CDI support."]
