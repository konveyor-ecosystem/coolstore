## Reasoning

To migrate the `StartupListener` class to Quarkus, we need to address the issue of replacing the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE namespace, which has replaced the Java EE namespace.

The `@Inject` annotation is used to inject the `Logger` instance, and since Quarkus uses Jakarta EE, we need to update the import statement to `jakarta.inject.Inject`.

We can refer to the solved example to see how similar issues were addressed in the past.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleEvent;
import weblogic.application.ApplicationLifecycleListener;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class StartupListener extends ApplicationLifecycleListener {

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    @Override
    public void postStart(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {
        log.info("AppListener(postStart)");
    }

    @Override
    public void preStop(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {
        log.info("AppListener(preStop)");
    }

}
```

## Additional Information (optional)

When updating the import statement, we need to ensure that the `jakarta.inject` dependency is added to the `pom.xml` file. This can be done by adding the following dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>jakarta.inject</groupId>
    <artifactId>jakarta.inject-api</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```
Note that the version of the dependency may vary depending on the Quarkus version being used.
