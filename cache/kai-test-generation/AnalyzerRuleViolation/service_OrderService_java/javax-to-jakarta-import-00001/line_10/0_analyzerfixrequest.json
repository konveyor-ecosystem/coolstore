      "content": "## Reasoning\nThe issue to be fixed is replacing the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`. This is because the project is being migrated to Jakarta EE, which uses the `jakarta` namespace instead of `javax`.\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the provided code, it appears that the import statements are already using the `jakarta.persistence` namespace. Therefore, no changes are required to the import statements.\n\nBut, the issue description mentions that the line number is 10, which corresponds to the `@Inject` annotation. However, the issue is not related to this annotation. It's possible that the issue is actually related to the `EntityManager` import statement, which is not shown in the provided code snippet.\n\nAssuming that the `EntityManager` import statement is actually using the `javax.persistence` namespace, we need to replace it with `jakarta.persistence`.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;\nimport java.util.List;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\nimport jakarta.inject.Named;\nimport jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;\nimport jakarta.persistence.criteria.CriteriaBuilder;\nimport jakarta.persistence.criteria.CriteriaQuery;\nimport jakarta.persistence.criteria.Root;\n\npublic class OrderService {\n\n  @Inject\n  @Named(\"entityManagerFactory\") // Define the name of the persistence unit\n  private EntityManager em;\n\n  public void save(Order order) {\n    em.persist(order);\n  }\n\n  public List<Order> getOrders() {\n    CriteriaBuilder cb = em.getCriteriaBuilder();\n    CriteriaQuery<Order> criteria = cb.createQuery(Order.class);\n    Root<Order> member = criteria.from(Order.class);\n    criteria.select(member);\n    return em.createQuery(criteria).getResultList();\n  }\n\n  public Order getOrderById(long id) {\n    return em.find(Order.class, id);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNo additional changes are required to the `pom.xml` file or other dependencies. The updated code should work as is. However, it's always a good idea to verify that the project builds and runs correctly after making changes.",
