      "content": "## Reasoning\nThe issue reported is that JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary in Quarkus. This means that we don't need to extend the `Application` class from `jakarta.ws.rs.core` package. \n\nHowever, the `@Path` annotation is still valid and can be used to set the root path for the application. But in Quarkus, it's not necessary to use `@Path` at the application level. Instead, we can configure the root path in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file.\n\nGiven the information, we can remove the `extends Application` part and keep the `@Path` annotation if we want to set the root path. But since the incident suggests that we don't have to set the root path, we can remove the `@Path` annotation as well.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.rest;\n\n/**\n * Rest Application\n */\npublic class RestApplication {\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNo changes are required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific change. However, if you're planning to use Quarkus, you'll need to add the Quarkus dependencies and plugins to your `pom.xml` file. \n\nAlso, note that the `jakarta.ws.rs` package is used in Java EE, but Quarkus uses the same package for JAX-RS. So, no import changes are required for this specific change. \n\nIn a real-world scenario, you would need to configure the Quarkus application and add the necessary dependencies and plugins to your `pom.xml` file. You would also need to update your application to use Quarkus-specific features and annotations.",
