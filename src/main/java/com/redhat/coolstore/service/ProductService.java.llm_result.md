## Reasoning

1. The first issue is about replacing the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb`. This is because in the Jakarta EE 9 release, the `javax.*` namespace has been replaced with `jakarta.*`. However, in Quarkus, we don't need to use EJBs at all. Instead, we can use CDI beans, which are more lightweight and flexible. Therefore, we can simply remove the `javax.ejb.Stateless` import statement.

2. The second issue is about replacing the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. Similar to the first issue, this is due to the namespace change in Jakarta EE 9. However, Quarkus uses the `javax.inject` namespace for dependency injection, so we can keep the `javax.inject.Inject` import statement.

3. The third issue is about converting the Stateless EJB to a CDI bean. In Quarkus, we can use the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to define a CDI bean that is created once and used across the application. This is similar to the behavior of a Stateless EJB, but it is more lightweight and flexible. Therefore, we can replace the `@Stateless` annotation with `@ApplicationScoped`.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.CatalogItemEntity;
import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Product;
import com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;

import javax.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

import static com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers.toProduct;

@ApplicationScoped
public class ProductService {

    @Inject
    CatalogService cm;

    public ProductService() {
    }

    public List<Product> getProducts() {
        return cm.getCatalogItems().stream().map(entity -> toProduct(entity)).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    public Product getProductByItemId(String itemId) {
        CatalogItemEntity entity = cm.getCatalogItemById(itemId);
        if (entity == null)
            return null;

        // Return the entity
        return Transformers.toProduct(entity);
    }

}
```

## Additional Information (optional)

No additional steps are required at this stage. The migration process will continue with other parts of the application in subsequent steps.
