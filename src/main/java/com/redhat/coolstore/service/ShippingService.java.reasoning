["1. **Issue 1 & 2:** The `javax.ejb` package is used in Java EE for Enterprise JavaBeans. However, Quarkus uses the `jakarta.ejb` package instead. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax.ejb` import statements with `jakarta.ejb` on lines 6 and 7.\n\n2. **Issue 3:** Remote EJBs are not supported in Quarkus. Instead, we can use REST functionality to expose the service as a REST endpoint. We will replace the `@Remote` annotation with `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path(\"<endpoint>\")` and remove the `@Stateless` annotation. We will also annotate each public method with `@jakarta.ws.rs.GET` and `@jakarta.ws.rs.Path(\"<endpoint>\")` to expose it as a REST endpoint.\n\n3. **Issue 4:** Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`."]
