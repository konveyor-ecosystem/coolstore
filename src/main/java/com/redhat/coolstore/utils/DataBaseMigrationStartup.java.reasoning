["1. **Identify the issues:** The issues identified are related to import statements that are using the `javax` namespace, which is the Java EE namespace. Quarkus uses the `jakarta` namespace, which is the Jakarta EE namespace. Therefore, we need to replace all the `javax` import statements with their corresponding `jakarta` import statements.\n\n2. **Replace `javax` import statements with `jakarta` import statements:**\n\n   - `javax.annotation.PostConstruct` is used to indicate that a method should be called automatically to initialize a bean, after the bean has been constructed and all dependencies have been injected. The equivalent in Jakarta EE is `jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct`.\n\n   - `javax.annotation.Resource` is used to inject resources into a Java EE application. The equivalent in Jakarta EE is `jakarta.annotation.Resource`.\n\n   - `javax.ejb.Singleton` is used to define a singleton session bean. The equivalent in Jakarta EE is `jakarta.ejb.Singleton`.\n\n   - `javax.ejb.Startup` is used to indicate that a bean should be initialized at the start of the application. The equivalent in Jakarta EE is `jakarta.ejb.Startup`.\n\n   - `javax.ejb.TransactionManagement` is used to specify the transaction management type for a bean. The equivalent in Jakarta EE is `jakarta.ejb.TransactionManagement`.\n\n   - `javax.ejb.TransactionManagementType` is used to specify the type of transaction management for a bean. The equivalent in Jakarta EE is `jakarta.ejb.TransactionManagementType`.\n\n   - `javax.inject.Inject` is used to inject a dependency into a field, method or constructor. The equivalent in Jakarta EE is `jakarta.inject.Inject`.\n\n   - `javax.sql.DataSource` is used to represent a database connection pool. This class is part of the JDBC API and is not affected by the Jakarta EE namespace change."]
