## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1:** The package `javax.ejb` has been replaced with `jakarta.ejb` in Jakarta EE 9 and later. This is a namespacing change to avoid conflicts with other specifications. Quarkus is built on top of Jakarta EE, so we need to make this change.

2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, the package `javax.inject` has been replaced with `jakarta.inject`.

3. **Issue 3, 4, 5, 6:** These are persistence-related imports that need to be updated to `jakarta.persistence`.

4. **Issue 7:** In Quarkus, we don't need to use `@PersistenceContext` to inject a data source. Instead, Quarkus creates the bean automatically when we correctly set up our datasource. The `@Produces` annotation is not needed and can be removed.

5. **Issue 8:** Stateless EJBs can be converted to a CDI bean by replacing the `@Stateless` annotation with a scope like `@ApplicationScoped`.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.persistence.EntityManager;
import jakarta.persistence.CriteriaBuilder;
import jakarta.persistence.CriteriaQuery;
import jakarta.persistence.Root;

@ApplicationScoped
public class OrderService {

  @Inject
  private EntityManager em;

  public void save(Order order) {
    em.persist(order);
  }

  public List<Order> getOrders() {
    CriteriaBuilder cb = em.getCriteriaBuilder();
    CriteriaQuery<Order> criteria = cb.createQuery(Order.class);
    Root<Order> member = criteria.from(Order.class);
    criteria.select(member);
    return em.createQuery(criteria).getResultList();
  }

  public Order getOrderById(long id) {
    return em.find(Order.class, id);
  }
}
```

## Additional Information

There are no additional steps needed in this case. The updated file should work as expected in a Quarkus environment. However, please note that this is a simple example and real-world applications might require additional changes.
