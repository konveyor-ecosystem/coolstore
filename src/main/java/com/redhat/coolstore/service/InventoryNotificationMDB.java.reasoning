["The migration process from Java EE to Quarkus involves several steps. The steps for this specific file are as follows:\n\n1. The first issue is related to replacing the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is required because Jakarta EE is the new home for cloud-native Java open source software. The change will have no impact on the functionality.\n\n2. The second issue is about replacing the JMS `Topic` with an Emitter feeding a Channel. In Quarkus, the usage of JMS is replaced by the `Emitter` and `Channel` constructs provided by the SmallRye Reactive Messaging extension. This change means that we need to update the way we send messages, from using a `Topic` to using an `Emitter`.\n\n3. The third issue is about replacing the JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents. The JMS APIs are not supported in Quarkus, so they need to be replaced with equivalent APIs from the SmallRye Reactive Messaging extension. This change will also require altering the method implementations that use the JMS APIs.\n\n4. The pom.xml might need to be updated to include the required dependencies for the SmallRye Reactive Messaging extension. The necessary dependency is:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>\n    <artifactId>smallrye-reactive-messaging</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```"]
