## Reasoning

1. The Java EE packages have been renamed to Jakarta EE in Java 11. This is why we need to replace `javax` with `jakarta` in the import statements. This change is necessary to ensure compatibility with Jakarta EE 9 and above.

2. `javax.ejb.Stateless` is a Java EE annotation for defining a Stateless Session Bean. In Quarkus, we can use CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) to manage the lifecycle of our beans. Therefore, we can replace `@Stateless` with a CDI scope annotation such as `@ApplicationScoped`.

3. JMS (Java Message Service) is a Java EE technology for sending and receiving messages. In Quarkus, we can use SmallRye's implementation of MicroProfile Reactive Messaging to replace JMS. This means that we need to replace the JMS `Topic` with a SmallRye `Emitter` that feeds a Channel.

4. We need to remove the `@Resource` annotation and replace it with an `@Inject` annotation to inject the `Emitter`. We also need to specify the name of the channel that the `Emitter` will feed.

5. We need to replace the `javax.jms` import statements with `jakarta.jms` import statements to ensure compatibility with Jakarta EE 9 and above.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import java.util.logging.Logger;
import jakarta.annotation.Inject;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import jakarta.jms.Emitter;
import jakarta.jms.JsonbMessage;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Channel;
import com.redhat.coolstore.model.ShoppingCart;
import com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;

@ApplicationScoped
public class ShoppingCartOrderProcessor  {

    @Inject
    Logger log;


    @Inject
    @Channel("orders")
    private Emitter<JsonbMessage> ordersEmitter;

    public void  process(ShoppingCart cart) {
        log.info("Sending order from processor: ");
        ordersEmitter.send(Transformers.shoppingCartToJsonMessage(cart));
    }



}
```

## Additional Information

We need to update the `Transformers` class to convert a `ShoppingCart` to a `JsonbMessage` instead of a `String`. We can use the `JsonMessage` class from the `jakarta.jms` package to create a JSON message.

We also need to add the following dependency to the `pom.xml` file to use SmallRye's implementation of MicroProfile Reactive Messaging:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.smallrye.reactive</groupId>
  <artifactId>smallrye-reactive-messaging-amqp</artifactId>
  <version>1.6.9</version>
</dependency>
```

We also need to add the following configuration to the `application.properties` file to specify the name of the channel that the `Emitter` will feed:

```
mp.messaging.outgoing.orders.connector=smallrye-reactive-messaging-amqp
mp.messaging.outgoing.orders.address=jms-queue://orders
```

This configuration specifies that we will use the SmallRye AMQP connector to send messages to a JMS queue named `orders`.
