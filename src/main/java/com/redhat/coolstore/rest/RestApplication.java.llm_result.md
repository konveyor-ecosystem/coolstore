## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1 & 2:** The Java EE API has been rebranded to Jakarta EE, which means that the package names have changed from `javax` to `jakarta`. This is a breaking change and needs to be reflected in the import statements.

2. **Issue 3 & 4:** In Quarkus, JAX-RS activation is not necessary as Quarkus automatically registers JAX-RS resources and providers. The `@ApplicationPath` annotation is still used to set the root path for the JAX-RS application, but it's not required. In this case, since we are only having one resource, we can remove the `@ApplicationPath` annotation and Quarkus will automatically register the `RestApplication` as a JAX-RS application with the root path set to "/services" by default.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;

public class RestApplication extends Application {

}
```

## Additional Information

- The `pom.xml` file does not need to be updated as part of this migration step, since we are not adding or removing any dependencies.
- The imports for `javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath` and `javax.ws.rs.core.Application` have been changed to `jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application`.
- The `@ApplicationPath` annotation and its value have been removed, as Quarkus will automatically register the `RestApplication` as a JAX-RS application with the root path set to "/services" by default.
