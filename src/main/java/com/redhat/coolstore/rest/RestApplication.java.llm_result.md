## Reasoning

1. The first step is to address Issue 1 and Issue 2, which involve replacing the `javax.ws` import statements with `jakarta.ws` on lines 3 and 4. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which has moved the `jakarta` package namespace from the old `javax` namespace.

2. The second step is to address Issue 3 and Issue 4, which concern the removal of JAX-RS activation. In Quarkus, JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary, and the root path can be set directly on the `Application` class. Since the class in our input file extends `Application`, we can simply remove the `@ApplicationPath` annotation.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;

// No need for @ApplicationPath annotation in Quarkus
// public class RestApplication extends Application {
// }
```

## Additional Information

1. Since we have removed the `@ApplicationPath` annotation, we no longer need to import the `javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath` class.

2. As we are not setting a root path explicitly, Quarkus will automatically use the default root path `/`.

3. The `pom.xml` file does not need to be updated for this step, as the required dependencies are already present in the original Java EE project. However, when migrating the entire project to Quarkus, the `pom.xml` file will need to be updated accordingly.
