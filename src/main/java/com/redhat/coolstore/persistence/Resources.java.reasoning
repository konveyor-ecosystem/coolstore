["1. The first step is to replace the `javax.enterprise` import statement with `jakarta.enterprise` as the Jakarta EE specifications have moved from the `javax` namespace to the `jakarta` namespace. This is due to Oracle's decision to not allow the Jakarta EE community to update specifications that use the `javax` namespace. This change allows for future versions of Jakarta EE to evolve.\n\n2. The second step is to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence` for the same reasons as above.\n\n3. The next step is to remove the `@PersistenceContext` annotation and change to `@Inject` the EntityManager. This is because in Quarkus, the EntityManager is created automatically when setting up your datasource. Therefore, there is no need to use the `@PersistenceContext` annotation which was required in JavaEE/JakartaEE. \n\n4. The `@Produces` annotation should be removed. In Quarkus, you can skip the `@Produces` annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. Therefore, `@Produces` is not needed here. \n\n5. To replace the `@Produces` annotation, we can use a `@Named` getter method. This will allow us to access the EntityManager field. \n\n6. Finally, the `@Dependent` annotation should be replaced with `@ApplicationScoped` as this is more appropriate in a Quarkus application. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation specifies that a bean is application scoped, meaning there is one instance of the bean that is shared by all its clients during the lifespan of a single application."]
