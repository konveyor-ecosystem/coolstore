["1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the `javax.enterprise` import statement needs to be replaced with `jakarta.enterprise` in order to migrate the code to Quarkus.\n2. The package names in Quarkus have been updated to align with the Jakarta EE specifications, hence the need to update the import statement.\n3. Apart from updating the import statement, no other changes are required in this code snippet to migrate to Quarkus.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the import statements are using `jakarta` instead of `javax` which is required for Quarkus.\n2. I will update the import statements from `jakarta` to `javax` as required for Quarkus.\n3. Additionally, I will ensure that any dependencies or plugins in the `pom.xml` file are updated accordingly to support Quarkus.", "1. The issue found in the static code analysis is to replace the `javax.ws` import statements with `jakarta.ws`.\n2. To migrate this Java EE code to Quarkus, we need to update the import statements to use `jakarta.ws` instead of `javax.ws`.\n3. We will update all the import statements in the file to reflect the correct package for Quarkus compatibility.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.ws` import statements with `jakarta.ws` as part of migrating from Java EE to Quarkus.\n2.
