      "content": "## Reasoning\n\nThe issue described is to replace the `javax.jms` import statement with `jakarta.jms`. However, upon reviewing the provided code, there is no `javax.jms` import statement present. \n\nThe code is using `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging` package which is part of SmallRye Reactive Messaging, a framework for building event-driven applications. It does not seem to be using JMS (Java Message Service) directly.\n\nHowever, considering the class name `OrderServiceMDB` and the method `onMessage`, it seems like this class is intended to be a Message-Driven Bean (MDB), which typically uses JMS.\n\nIf we assume that the intention is to use JMS, we would need to add the necessary import statements and annotations. But since the code is not using JMS directly, we will not make any changes to the code.\n\nBut if we were to use JMS, we would need to add the `@MessageDriven` annotation and import the necessary classes from `jakarta.jms`. We would also need to update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary dependencies for JMS.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\n// No changes are made to the file as there is no javax.jms import statement present.\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Channel;\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Emitter;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\npublic class OrderServiceMDB {\n\n    @Inject\n    OrderService orderService;\n\n    @Inject\n    CatalogService catalogService;\n\n    @Inject\n    @Channel(\"topic/orders\")\n    Emitter<String> emitter;\n\n    @Channel(\"topic/orders\")\n    public void onMessage(String message) {\n        System.out.println(\"\\nMessage recd !\");\n        try {\n            Order order = Transformers.jsonToOrder(message);\n            System.out.println(\"Order object is \" + order);\n            orderService.save(order);\n            order.getItemList().forEach(orderItem -> {\n                catalogService.updateInventoryItems(orderItem.getProductId(), orderItem.getQuantity());\n            });\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(e);\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\n\nIf the intention is to use JMS, the following changes would be necessary:\n\n* Add the `@MessageDriven` annotation to the class.\n* Import the necessary classes from `jakarta.jms`.\n* Update the `pom.xml` file to include the necessary dependencies for JMS.\n\nExample of the updated code:\n```java\nimport jakarta.jms.Message;\nimport jakarta.jms.MessageListener;\nimport jakarta.jms.TextMessage;\nimport jakarta.ejb.MessageDriven;\n\n@MessageDriven\npublic class OrderServiceMDB implements MessageListener {\n\n    // ...\n}\n```\nAnd the `pom.xml` file would need to include the following dependencies:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>jakarta.jms</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jakarta.jms-api</artifactId>\n    <version>3.0.0</version>\n</dependency>\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.jboss.spec.javax.jms</groupId>\n    <artifactId>jboss-jms-api_2.0_spec</artifactId>\n    <version>1.0.0.Final</version>\n</dependency>\n```",
