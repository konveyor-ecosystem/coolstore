## Reasoning

1. The first step is to address the issues related to the import statements. The Java EE code uses the `javax` package for annotations, while Quarkus uses the `jakarta` package. This is due to the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE. Therefore, we need to replace the `javax` imports with `jakarta` imports.

2. The first two issues are for the `@PostConstruct` and `@Resource` annotations. These are used for lifecycle management and resource injection respectively. In Quarkus, these annotations can be found in the `jakarta.annotation` package.

3. The next three issues are for the `@Singleton`, `@Startup`, and `@TransactionManagement` annotations. These are EJB annotations used for managing the lifecycle of the bean, specifying when it should be started, and managing transactions. In Quarkus, these annotations can be found in the `jakarta.ejb` package.

4. The last issue is for the `@Inject` annotation, which is used for dependency injection in Quarkus. This annotation can be found in the `jakarta.inject` package.

5. After addressing these issues, the code should be compatible with Quarkus. However, it's important to note that the `javax.sql.DataSource` import is not replaced because Quarkus does not provide a DataSource interface in the `jakarta.sql` package. This is because Quarkus uses its own way of managing datasources.

6. The `Flyway` class is a third-party library for database migration. It should work in Quarkus as long as it's added as a dependency in the `pom.xml` file.

public class DataBaseMigrationStartup {

    @Inject
    Logger logger;

    @Resource(mappedName = "java:jboss/datasources/CoolstoreDS")
    DataSource dataSource;

    @PostConstruct
    private void startup() {


        try {
            logger.info("Initializing/migrating the database using FlyWay");
            Flyway flyway = new Flyway();
            flyway.setDataSource(dataSource);
            flyway.baseline();
            // Start the db.migration
            flyway.migrate();
        } catch (FlywayException e) {
            if(logger !=null)
                logger.log(Level.SEVERE,"FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: " + e.getMessage(),e);
            else
                System.out.println("FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: " + e.getMessage() + " and injection of logger doesn't work");

        }
    }



}
```

## Additional Information

After updating the imports, the code should work in Quarkus. However, it's recommended to check the Quarkus documentation for any specific configurations or annotations that might be needed. Also, the datasource configuration should be checked and updated according to the Quarkus configuration.
