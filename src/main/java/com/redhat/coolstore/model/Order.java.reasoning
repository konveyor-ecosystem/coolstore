["1. The main issue to address is replacing the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence` as part of migrating from Java EE to Quarkus.\n2. In Quarkus, the standard package for persistence is `jakarta.persistence`, so we need to update the import statements accordingly.\n3. We will also need to consider updating any dependencies in the `pom.xml` file that might be related to persistence.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.persistence` import statements with `jakarta.persistence`.\n2. Quarkus uses the `jakarta.persistence` package for JPA annotations instead of the `javax.persistence` package used in Java EE.\n3. We need to update the import statements and ensure that the annotations are correctly imported from the `jakarta.persistence` package.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the import statements for `javax.persistence` need to be replaced with `jakarta.persistence` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus.\n2. The `javax.persistence` package has been replaced by the `jakarta.persistence` package in the Quarkus framework, so we need to update the import statements accordingly.", "1. The main issue to address is replacing the `javax.persistence` import statements with `jakarta.persistence` as stated in the static code analysis.\n2. Since Quarkus follows the Jakarta EE specifications, we need to update the import statements accordingly.\n3. We will update the import statements from `javax.persistence` to `jakarta.persistence` throughout the file.", "1. The static code analysis identified the issue of using `jakarta.persistence` instead of `javax.persistence` which needs to be fixed to migrate to Quarkus.\n2. In Quarkus, the package name for persistence annotations has been changed from `javax.persistence` to `jakarta.persistence` to align with Jakarta EE specifications.\n3. To address the issue, we need to replace all occurrences of `javax.persistence` with `jakarta.persistence` in the import statements and annotations.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is that the import statement for `javax.persistence` needs to be replaced with `jakarta.persistence` as part of the migration from Java EE to Quarkus.\n2. Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE specifications, so we need to update the imports to reflect this change.", "1. The main issue identified from static code analysis is the use of `jakarta.persistence` instead of `javax.persistence` which is required in Quarkus for JPA annotations.\n2. To resolve this issue, we need to replace all `jakarta.persistence` import statements with `javax.persistence`.\n3. We will update the import statements in the Order.java file accordingly.", "1. The issue found from static code analysis is to replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`.\n2. Quarkus supports Jakarta EE APIs, so we need to update the import statements to use `jakarta.persistence` instead of `javax.persistence`.\n3. We will update the import statements and make sure the code remains compatible with Quarkus.", "1. The issue found in the static code analysis is that the import statements are using `jakarta.persistence` instead of `javax.persistence`. In Quarkus, we need to use `jakarta.persistence` as it follows the Jakarta EE specification.\n2. We need to update the import statements from `jakarta.persistence` to `javax.persistence`.\n3. No other changes are required for this migration."]
