## Reasoning

1. The first issue to address is the namespace used in the `beans.xml` file. The current namespace `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` needs to be updated to `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee` to reflect the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE.
2. The second issue is the schema location, which needs to be updated to the new Jakarta EE namespace as well.
3. The third issue is the schema version number, which needs to be updated to `beans_3_0.xsd` to reflect the latest CDI specification version.
4. The last issue is that the `beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored in Quarkus and it could be removed from the application. However, we will keep it for this step to show the changes required to make it compatible with Quarkus.

## Updated File

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!-- Marker file indicating CDI should be enabled -->
<beans xmlns="https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="
      https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee
      https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee/beans_3_0.xsd"
    bean-discovery-mode="all">
</beans>
```

## Additional Information

In the next steps, we will remove the `beans.xml` file as it is not required in Quarkus. We will also update the `pom.xml` file to remove any unnecessary dependencies and configurations.
