The current namespace `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence` is for Java EE, and the task requires migration to Jakarta EE. \n\nTo address this issue, we need to update the namespace to `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence`, which is the correct namespace for Jakarta EE. Additionally, we need to update the schema version number to match the Jakarta EE version.\n\nHowever, the provided `persistence.xml` file is empty, and the comment suggests that it should be removed and its configurations moved to a properties file, such as `application.properties`. \n\nGiven the information, we will update the namespace and schema version, but also note that the file should be removed and its configurations moved to a properties file.\n\n## Updated xml File\n```xml\n<!-- This file should be removed and its configurations moved to a properties file, such as application.properties.\nIf it were to be updated, the namespace and schema version would be changed as follows:\n<persistence xmlns=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence\"\n             xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n             xsi:schemaLocation=\"https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence\n             https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_3_0.xsd\"\n             version=\"3.0\">\n</persistence>\n-->\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nTo complete the migration, the `persistence.xml` file should be removed, and its configurations moved to a properties file, such as `application.properties`. The updated namespace and schema version should be used in the new configuration file.\n\nAdditionally, the `pom.xml` file may need to be updated to reflect the changes in the namespace and schema version. The Jakarta EE dependencies should be updated to the correct version, and the Java EE dependencies should be removed or replaced.\n\nThe imports in the Java files may also need to be updated to reflect the changes in the namespace and schema version. The Jakarta EE imports should be used instead of the Java EE imports.",
