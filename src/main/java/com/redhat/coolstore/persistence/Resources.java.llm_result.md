## Reasoning

1. The first two issues are related to the import statements that are using the `javax` package. In Quarkus, we need to replace these with the `jakarta` package. This is because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, which is the successor to Java EE.
2. The third and fourth issues are also related to the import statements that are using the `javax` package. We need to replace these with the `jakarta` package for the same reason as in step 1.
3. The fifth issue is related to the use of the `@PersistenceContext` annotation to inject an `EntityManager`. In Quarkus, we don't need to use this annotation because Quarkus will automatically create the `EntityManager` for us. We can simply inject the `EntityManager` using the `@Inject` annotation.
4. The sixth issue is related to the use of the `@Produces` annotation on the `getEntityManager()` method. In Quarkus, we can skip this annotation if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. In this case, we can use the `@Named` annotation to get the `EntityManager`.
