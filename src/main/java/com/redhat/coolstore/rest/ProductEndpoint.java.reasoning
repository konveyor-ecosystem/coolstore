["In general, the migration from Java EE to Quarkus requires changing the import statements to use the Jakarta APIs instead of the Java EE APIs. This is as a result of Java EE being rebranded to Jakarta EE.\n\n1. We need to replace `javax.enterprise` with `jakarta.enterprise`. This is because in Quarkus, the `javax.enterprise` package is not used anymore and has been replaced with `jakarta.enterprise`.\n\n2. Similarly, `javax.inject` should be replaced with `jakarta.inject`. The `javax.inject` package is not used anymore in Quarkus and has been replaced with `jakarta.inject`.\n\n3. Lastly, we replace `javax.ws.rs` with `jakarta.ws.rs`. The `javax.ws.rs` package is not used anymore in Quarkus and has been replaced with `jakarta.ws.rs`.\n\nNote: It's also important to consider if the application dependencies are compatible with these changes. Typically, the dependencies in the pom.xml file would need to be updated to versions that are compatible with Jakarta EE. However, we don't have the pom.xml file in this case, so we'll focus on the code changes."]
