["The migration from JavaEE to Quarkus requires several steps:\n\n1. The first two issues are related to the import of the `javax.enterprise` package. This package has been replaced by `jakarta.enterprise` in JakartaEE which is followed by Quarkus. Thus, we have to replace `javax.enterprise` with `jakarta.enterprise` in the import statements.\n\n2. The third issue is about the `@Produces` annotation. In Quarkus, you can skip the `@Produces` annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. As suggested, this field could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead. So, we will replace the `@Produces` annotation with the `@ApplicationScoped` and `@Named` annotations. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation defines that a bean is application scoped and the `@Named` annotation allows us to specify the name for the getter method.\n\n3. Also, we need to replace the standard `java.util.logging.Logger` with the `org.jboss.logging.Logger` as it is the preferred way of using logs in Quarkus.\n\n4. It is important to note that changes to the import statements and annotations may require corresponding updates in the pom.xml file. In this case, the pom.xml file should be updated to include the `quarkus-cdi` and `quarkus-jboss-logging` dependencies if they are not already present."]
