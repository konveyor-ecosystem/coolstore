["1. The first step is to address the issues found from the static analysis. We need to replace the `javax.persistence` import statements with `jakarta.persistence` as Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE API, not the Java EE API. This change is required in lines 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.\n\n2. The second step is to replace the `javax.xml` import statement with `jakarta.xml` in line 10, following the same reasoning as step 1.\n\n3. We don't need to make any changes to the package declaration, class definition, or annotations since they are technology-agnostic and compatible with Quarkus.\n\n4. The constructor, getter, and setter methods do not need any changes, as they are standard Java practices and not tied to any specific technology.\n\n5. The `toString()` method can remain the same, as it is a standard Java method for displaying a human-readable representation of an object.\n\n6. Since we don't have any external dependencies or imports to consider, we can focus on updating the existing imports."]
