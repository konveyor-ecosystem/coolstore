["The provided Java EE code uses `javax.enterprise.context.Dependent` for using the `@Dependent` annotation. But In Jakarta EE or in Quarkus, the package `javax.*` is replaced by `jakarta.*`. So, we need to replace the `javax.enterprise` import with `jakarta.enterprise`.\n\nThere are no other changes required in this file for converting it into Quarkus. The remaining code is standard Java which is compatible with Quarkus.\n\nAlso, there are no changes required in the `pom.xml` file for this specific Java file. However, please make sure that `jakarta.enterprise:jakarta.enterprise.cdi-api` dependency is added in the `pom.xml` file to use `jakarta.enterprise.context.Dependent`."]
