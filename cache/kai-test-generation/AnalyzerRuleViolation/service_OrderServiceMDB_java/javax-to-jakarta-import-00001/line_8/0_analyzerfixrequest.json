However, upon reviewing the provided code, it appears that there is no `javax.jms` import statement present in the file. \n\nInstead, the code is using `io.smallrye.reactive.messaging` package which is part of the SmallRye Reactive Messaging framework, and `jakarta.inject` package which is part of the Jakarta EE specification.\n\nSince there is no `javax.jms` import statement to replace, no changes are required to the code. However, it's worth noting that if the code was using `javax.jms` package, it would need to be replaced with `jakarta.jms` to align with the Jakarta EE specification.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.service;\n\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Channel;\nimport io.smallrye.reactive.messaging.Emitter;\nimport jakarta.inject.Inject;\n\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;\nimport com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;\n\npublic class OrderServiceMDB {\n\n    @Inject\n    OrderService orderService;\n\n    @Inject\n    CatalogService catalogService;\n\n    @Inject\n    @Channel(\"topic/orders\")\n    Emitter<String> emitter;\n\n    @Channel(\"topic/orders\")\n    public void onMessage(String message) {\n        System.out.println(\"\\nMessage recd !\");\n        try {\n            Order order = Transformers.jsonToOrder(message);\n            System.out.println(\"Order object is \" + order);\n            orderService.save(order);\n            order.getItemList().forEach(orderItem -> {\n                catalogService.updateInventoryItems(orderItem.getProductId(), orderItem.getQuantity());\n            });\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n            throw new RuntimeException(e);\n        }\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information (optional)\nNo additional changes are required to the `pom.xml` file or imports as a result of this update.",
