      "content": "## Reasoning\nTo address the issue described, we need to consider the differences in how Quarkus handles producers compared to Java EE. In Quarkus, we can skip the `@Produces` annotation if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier.\n\nHowever, in this case, the suggestion is to replace the field with a `@Named` getter method. This is because Quarkus uses CDI (Context and Dependency Injection) under the hood, and `@Named` is a CDI annotation that allows us to expose a bean as a named bean.\n\nWe will replace the `log` field with a getter method annotated with `@Named` and `@ApplicationScoped`. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is used to define the scope of the bean, which in this case is the application scope.\n\nWe will also remove the `@Produces` annotation from the `produceLog` method, as it is no longer needed.\n\n## Updated java File\n```java\npackage com.redhat.coolstore.utils;\n\nimport jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.Named;\nimport jakarta.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;\nimport java.util.logging.Logger;\n\n/**\n * This class is a helper class that provides a logger producer.\n */\npublic class Producers {\n\n    @Named\n    @ApplicationScoped\n    public Logger getLogger() {\n        return Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());\n    }\n\n    public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {\n        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\n## Additional Information\nNote that we have added the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to the `getLogger` method. This is because in Quarkus, beans are not scoped by default, and we need to explicitly define the scope.\n\nAlso, we have removed the `log` field, as it is no longer needed. The `getLogger` method will now provide the logger instance.\n\nIn the `pom.xml` file, we need to make sure that the Quarkus CDI extension is included. This can be done by adding the following dependency:\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>\n    <artifactId>quarkus-arc</artifactId>\n</dependency>\n```\nThis dependency includes the Quarkus implementation of CDI, which is required for the `@Named` and `@ApplicationScoped` annotations to work.",
